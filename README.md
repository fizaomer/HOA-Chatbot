# üè† HOA Chatbot

An intelligent chatbot that can answer questions about your HOA bylaws and CC&Rs using AI-powered document analysis.

## Features

- **PDF Processing**: Automatically extracts and processes text from HOA documents
- **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant sections using advanced text embeddings
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Generates accurate answers based on your specific HOA documents
- **Web Interface**: Beautiful Streamlit interface for easy interaction
- **Source Tracking**: Shows which documents were referenced for each answer

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 3. Process Your PDF Documents

```bash
python src/pdf_processor.py
```

This will:
- Extract text from your PDF files
- Clean and structure the content
- Save processed data to `data/processed_documents.json`

### 4. Launch the Chatbot

```bash
streamlit run src/chatbot.py
```

The chatbot will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## How It Works

### 1. Document Processing
- **PDF Extraction**: Uses `pdfplumber` to extract text from your HOA documents
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes formatting artifacts and normalizes text
- **Section Splitting**: Breaks documents into manageable chunks for analysis

### 2. Semantic Search
- **Embeddings**: Creates vector representations of document sections using `sentence-transformers`
- **Similarity Matching**: Finds the most relevant sections for any question
- **Context Retrieval**: Provides relevant document sections to the AI

### 3. AI Response Generation
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for natural language responses
- **Context-Aware**: Answers are based on your specific HOA documents
- **Source Attribution**: Shows which documents were referenced

## Example Questions

The chatbot can answer questions like:

- "What are the parking rules in our community?"
- "How much are the monthly HOA fees?"
- "Can I have pets in my unit?"
- "What modifications can I make to my property?"
- "How do I submit a complaint?"
- "Are there restrictions on renting my property?"
- "What are the quiet hours?"
- "How do I contact the HOA board?"

## Configuration

### Customizing the Chatbot

You can modify the chatbot behavior by editing `src/chatbot.py`:

- **Model Selection**: Change the OpenAI model (default: `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- **Response Length**: Adjust `max_tokens` parameter
- **Temperature**: Control response creativity (default: `0.3`)
- **Search Results**: Change `top_k` for number of relevant sections

### Adding More Documents

Simply add new PDF files to the project directory and re-run:

```bash
python src/pdf_processor.py
```

The chatbot will automatically include the new documents in its knowledge base.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Data file not found"**
   - Run `python src/pdf_processor.py` first to process your PDFs

2. **"OpenAI API key not found"**
   - Make sure you have a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key

3. **PDF processing errors**
   - Ensure PDFs are not password-protected
   - Check that PDFs contain extractable text (not just images)

4. **Memory issues with large documents**
   - The system automatically chunks large documents
   - If issues persist, reduce `max_chunk_size` in `pdf_processor.py`

### Performance Tips

- **Faster Processing**: Use smaller chunk sizes for quicker embedding generation
- **Better Accuracy**: Increase `top_k` for more comprehensive search results
- **Cost Optimization**: Use `gpt-3.5-turbo` instead of `gpt-4` for lower costs

## API Usage

You can also use the chatbot programmatically:

```python
from src.chatbot import HOAChatbot

# Initialize chatbot
chatbot = HOAChatbot()

# Ask a question
result = chatbot.answer_question("What are the parking rules?")
print(result['answer'])
```
