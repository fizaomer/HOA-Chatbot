Turtle Rock Crest - (Final) dpb 04152025\nAMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS\nOF\nTURTLE ROCK CREST MAINTENANCE ASSOCIATION\nARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS, NAME AND PURPOSE\n1.1 Definitions and Interpretation. Unless expressly defined herein, the\ndefinitions for capitalized terms used in these Bylaws shall have the\nmeaning set forth in Article I of the Amended and Restated Declaration of\nCovenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Turtle Rock Crest\nMaintenance Association and any amendments thereto, as Recorded in\nthe Official Records of the County (“Declaration”).\n1.2 Name and Principal Office. The name of the Association is Turtle Rock\nCrest Maintenance Association (“Association”). The principal office of the\nAssociation shall be located in Orange County, California, or at such other\nplace reasonably convenient to the Project as the Board of Directors may\nestablish from time to time.\n1.3 Purpose. The purpose of the Association shall be as set forth in its\nArticles of Incorporation.\nARTICLE II – Membership\n2.1 Qualifications. Every Owner of a Condominium shall automatically be a\nMember of the Association and retain such Membership until such time\nOwner’s ownership of a Condominium ceases, at which time such\nOwner’s Membership shall automatically cease. Ownership of a\nCondominium is the sole qualification for Membership. Memberships are\nnot assignable except to the Person to whom title to the Condominium is\ntransferred, and every Membership is appurtenant to, and may not be\nseparated from, the fee ownership of such Condominium. The rights,\nduties, privileges, and obligations of all Members are as provided in the\nGoverning Documents.\n2.2 Transfer of Membership. The Membership of any Owner may not be\ntransferred, pledged, or alienated in any way, except upon the transfer of\nownership to the Owner’s Condominium and then only to the transferee of\nsuch Condominium. A prohibited transfer is void and will not be reflected\nin the records of the Association. Any Owner who has sold a\nCondominium to a contract purchaser under an agreement to purchase\nmay delegate such Owner’s Membership rights to such contract\npurchaser. Such delegation must be in writing and must be delivered to\nthe Association before the contract purchaser may vote. The contract\nseller shall remain liable for all charges and Assessments attributable to\nsuch contract seller’s Condominium that accrue before title to the\nCondominium is transferred. If an Owner fails or refuses to transfer such\n1\nAmended and Restated Bylaws - Turtle Rock Crest - (Final) dpb 04152025\nOwner’s Membership to the purchaser of such Owner’s Condominium\nupon transfer of title thereto, then the Association may record the transfer\nin the Association’s records. Until satisfactory evidence of such transfer is\npresented to the Association, the purchaser will not be entitled to vote on\nAssociation matters.\n2.3 Owner’s Duty to Annually Provide Preferred Delivery Information. As\nrequired by Applicable Law, each Member shall annually provide written\nnotice to the Association of all of the following: (i) the Member’s preferred\ndelivery method for receiving notices from the Association, including either\na mailing address, a valid email address, or both, (ii) an alternative or\nsecondary delivery method, if any, to which notices from the Association\nare to be delivered, including either a mailing address, a valid email\naddress, or both, (iii) the name, mailing address and valid email address\n(if available) of the Owner’s legal representative, if any, including any\nperson with power of attorney or other person who can be contacted in the\nevent of the Member’s extended absence from the Unit, and (iv) whether\nthe Unit is Owner-occupied, is rented out, or if the Unit is vacant. If a\nMember fails to provide notice to the Association of the information set\nforth in (i), (ii), and (iii) above, the last mailing address provided in writing\nby the Member or, if none, the Unit property address, is deemed to be the\naddress to which the Association shall deliver notices. For purposes of\nthis Section, a “valid email address” is one that, after a notice is sent, does\nnot result in a bounce back or other error notification indicating failure of\nthe message to be delivered. If the Association delivers a notice to a\nMember’s email address and finds that the email address provided is not\nvalid, the Association shall resend the notice to a mailing or email address\nas provided by the Members.\n2.4 Voting Rights. The Association has one class of Membership. Members\nare entitled to one (1) vote for each Condominium owned.\n2.5 Joint Ownership. When more than one (1) Person holds an interest in\nany Condominium, each co-Owner may attend any Association meeting,\nbut only one (1) such co-Owner shall be entitled to exercise the single\nvote to which the Condominium is entitled. Co-Owners owning the majority\ninterests in a Condominium may designate in writing one (1) of their\nnumber to vote. Fractional votes shall not be allowed, and the vote for\neach Condominium shall be exercised, if at all, as a Unit. Where no voting\nco-Owner is designated or if any such designation is revoked, the vote for\nthe Condominium shall be exercised as the co-Owners owning the\nmajority interests in the Condominium agree. Unless the Association\nreceives a written objection in advance from a co-Owner, it shall be\nconclusively presumed that the voting co-Owner is acting with all other co-\nOwners’ consent. No vote may be cast for any Condominium if the co-\nOwners present in person or by proxy owning the majority interests in\nsuch Condominium fail to agree on how to vote or take other action. The\n2\nAmended and Restated Bylaws - Turtle Rock Crest - (Final) dpb 04152025\nnon-voting co-Owner or co-Owners are jointly and severally responsible\nfor all obligations imposed on the jointly-owned Condominium and are\nentitled to all other benefits of ownership.

For purposes of this Section, a “valid email address” is one that, after a notice is sent, does not result in a bounce back or other error notification indicating failure of the message to be delivered.

The Association has one class of Membership. Members are entitled to one (1) vote for each Condominium owned. 2.5 Joint Ownership. When more than one (1) Person holds an interest in any Condominium, each co-Owner may attend any Association meeting, but only one (1) such co-Owner shall be entitled to exercise the single vote to which the Condominium is entitled. Co-Owners owning the majority interests in a Condominium may designate in writing one (1) of their number to vote. Fractional votes shall not be allowed, and the vote for each Condominium shall be exercised, if at all, as a Unit. Where no voting co-Owner is designated or if any such designation is revoked, the vote for the Condominium shall be exercised as the co-Owners owning the majority interests in the Condominium agree. Unless the Association receives a written objection in advance from a co-Owner, it shall be conclusively presumed that the voting co-Owner is acting with all other co- Owners’ consent. No vote may be cast for any Condominium if the co- Owners present in person or by proxy owning the majority interests in such Condominium fail to agree on how to vote or take other action. The 2 Amended and Restated Bylaws - Turtle Rock Crest - (Final) dpb 04152025 non-voting co-Owner or co-Owners are jointly and severally responsible for all obligations imposed on the jointly-owned Condominium and are entitled to all other benefits of ownership.

Members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, despite the withdrawal of enough Members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of a quorum. If a meeting cannot be held because a quorum is not present, a majority of the Members present may adjourn the meeting to a time not less than five (5) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the time the original meeting was called at which meeting the quorum requirement will be twenty-five percent (25%) of the Association’s Total Voting Power. 2.8 Proxies.

To the extent provided in Civil Code section 4910, the Board may not take action by unanimous written consent without a meeting except in case of emergency and then only by electronic transmission, including email as provided in Civil Code section 4910(b)(2). Any such written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board. 5.10 Quorum. Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Bylaws, at all meetings of the Board, a majority of the directors then in office (but not less than two) constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business, and the acts of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present are the acts of the Board. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business, despite the withdrawal of directors leaving a number fewer than that required for quorum, if any action taken or decision made is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting. 5.11 Voting by Directors. Pursuant to Corporations Code section 7211(c), each director shall be entitled to one (1) vote and a director may not vote by proxy or otherwise delegate his or her right to vote on any matter before the Board. 5.12 Minutes of Director Meetings.

However, nothing in these Bylaws precludes any officer from serving the Association in some other capacity and receiving compensation from the Association therefor, and any officer may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in the performance of Association duties.

As provided in Section 5.12, any matter discussed in executive session shall be generally noted in the minutes of the next following open meeting of the Board.

The Board may adopt and publish reasonable Rules establishing procedures relating to a Member’s inspection and obtaining copies of Association records. 7.3 Director Inspection Rights. As provided in Corporations Code section 8334, and subject to any limitations established by Applicable Law, every director shall have the right at any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records, and documents and to inspect the physical properties of the Association. ARTICLE VIII – Amendments 8.1 By the Members. These Bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of Members representing at least a majority of a quorum of the Total Voting Power of the Association; provided that the specified percentage of approval necessary to amend a specific provision of these Bylaws may not be less than the percentage of affirmative votes prescribed for action to be taken under that provision. 8.2 By the Board. These Bylaws may be amended by the Board without the approval of the Members or Mortgagees if the amendment is: (a) to conform the Bylaws to Applicable Law, or (b) to correct typographical errors. 8.3 Record of Amendments. After a Bylaws amendment is adopted, it shall be placed in the appropriate place in the minute book of the Association together with a certificate signed by the Secretary stating the date on which it was approved by the Board, or the date on which it was approved by the Members, as applicable. 18 Amended and Restated Bylaws - Turtle Rock Crest - (Final) dpb 04152025 ARTICLE IX - Miscellaneous 9.1 Conflicts. If any provision of these Bylaws conflicts with Applicable Law, then such conflicting provision shall be void upon final court determination to such effect, but all other provisions shall remain in full force.

In case of any conflict between the Declaration and these Bylaws, the Declaration shall control. 9.2 Reference to Statutes; Time for Performance. References in the Bylaws to particular statutes, including sections of the Civil Code or the Corporations Code, shall be deemed to include any successor statute and any amendments to existing or successor statutes. Whenever these Bylaws state a time for the performance of any act by the Association which by law (as it may exist from time to time) must be performed at or within a specified time, the time for the performance of such act shall be deemed to be the widest timeframe permitted under then-applicable law. 19 Amended and Restated Bylaws - Turtle Rock Crest - (Final) dpb",

Unless expressly defined herein, the definitions for capitalized terms used in these Bylaws shall have the meaning set forth in Article I of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Turtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association and any amendments thereto, as Recorded in the Official Records of the County (“Declaration”). 1.2 Name and Principal Office.",
      "The name of the Association is Turtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association (“Association”). The principal office of the Association shall be located in Orange County, California, or at such other place reasonably convenient to the Project as the Board of Directors may establish from time to time. 1.3 Purpose. The purpose of the Association shall be as set forth in its Articles of Incorporation. ARTICLE II – Membership 2.1 Qualifications. Every Owner of a Condominium shall automatically be a Member of the Association and retain such Membership until such time Owner’s ownership of a Condominium ceases, at which time such Owner’s Membership shall automatically cease. Ownership of a Condominium is the sole qualification for Membership. Memberships are not assignable except to the Person to whom title to the Condominium is transferred, and every Membership is appurtenant to, and may not be separated from, the fee ownership of such Condominium.",
      "The rights, duties, privileges, and obligations of all Members are as provided in the Governing Documents. 2.2 Transfer of Membership. The Membership of any Owner may not be transferred, pledged, or alienated in any way, except upon the transfer of ownership to the Owner’s Condominium and then only to the transferee of such Condominium. A prohibited transfer is void and will not be reflected in the records of the Association. Any Owner who has sold a Condominium to a contract purchaser under an agreement to purchase may delegate such Owner’s Membership rights to such contract purchaser. Such delegation must be in writing and must be delivered to the Association before the contract purchaser may vote. The contract seller shall remain liable for all charges and Assessments attributable to such contract seller’s Condominium that accrue before title to the Condominium is transferred.",
      "If an Owner fails or refuses to transfer such 1 Amended and Restated Bylaws - Turtle Rock Crest - (Final) dpb 04152025 Owner’s Membership to the purchaser of such Owner’s Condominium upon transfer of title thereto, then the Association may record the transfer in the Association’s records. Until satisfactory evidence of such transfer is presented to the Association, the purchaser will not be entitled to vote on Association matters. 2.3 Owner’s Duty to Annually Provide Preferred Delivery Information.",
      "As required by Applicable Law, each Member shall annually provide written notice to the Association of all of the following: (i) the Member’s preferred delivery method for receiving notices from the Association, including either a mailing address, a valid email address, or both, (ii) an alternative or secondary delivery method, if any, to which notices from the Association are to be delivered, including either a mailing address, a valid email address, or both, (iii) the name, mailing address and valid email address (if available) of the Owner’s legal representative, if any, including any person with power of attorney or other person who can be contacted in the event of the Member’s extended absence from the Unit, and (iv) whether the Unit is Owner-occupied, is rented out, or if the Unit is vacant.",
      "If a Member fails to provide notice to the Association of the information set forth in (i), (ii), and (iii) above, the last mailing address provided in writing by the Member or, if none, the Unit property address, is deemed to be the address to which the Association shall deliver notices. For purposes of this Section, a “valid email address” is one that, after a notice is sent, does not result in a bounce back or other error notification indicating failure of the message to be delivered. If the Association delivers a notice to a Member’s email address and finds that the email address provided is not valid, the Association shall resend the notice to a mailing or email address as provided by the Members. 2.4 Voting Rights. The Association has one class of Membership. Members are entitled to one (1) vote for each Condominium owned. 2.5 Joint Ownership.",
      "When more than one (1) Person holds an interest in any Condominium, each co-Owner may attend any Association meeting, but only one (1) such co-Owner shall be entitled to exercise the single vote to which the Condominium is entitled. Co-Owners owning the majority interests in a Condominium may designate in writing one (1) of their number to vote. Fractional votes shall not be allowed, and the vote for each Condominium shall be exercised, if at all, as a Unit. Where no voting co-Owner is designated or if any such designation is revoked, the vote for the Condominium shall be exercised as the co-Owners owning the majority interests in the Condominium agree. Unless the Association receives a written objection in advance from a co-Owner, it shall be conclusively presumed that the voting co-Owner is acting with all other co- Owners’ consent.",
      "No vote may be cast for any Condominium if the co- Owners present in person or by proxy owning the majority interests in such Condominium fail to agree on how to vote or take other action. The 2 Amended and Restated Bylaws - Turtle Rock Crest - (Final) dpb 04152025 non-voting co-Owner or co-Owners are jointly and severally responsible for all obligations imposed on the jointly-owned Condominium and are entitled to all other benefits of ownership. All agreements and determinations lawfully made by the Association in accordance with the voting percentages established in the Governing Documents are binding on all Owners and their successors in interest. 2.6 Majority of Quorum. Unless otherwise provided in the Governing Documents, any action that may be taken by the Association may be taken by a majority of a quorum of the Association’s Total Voting Power. 2.7 Quorum.",
      "For all elections, except as otherwise provided in the Governing Documents, or otherwise required by Applicable Law, the presence, in person or by written ballot, of at least fifty percent (50%) of the Association’s Total Voting Power constitutes a quorum. Members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, despite the withdrawal of enough Members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of a quorum. If a meeting cannot be held because a quorum is not present, a majority of the Members present may adjourn the meeting to a time not less than five (5) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the time the original meeting was called at which meeting the quorum requirement will be twenty-five percent (25%) of the Association’s Total Voting Power. 2.8 Proxies.

The deadline for returning a secret ballot shall be at least 3 Amended and Restated Bylaws - Turtle Rock Crest - (Final) dpb 04152025 thirty (30) days from the date of mailing.

      "The Association shall cause to be sent to each Owner of record, and to each first Mortgagee who has filed a written request for notice with the Association, a notice of each annual meeting of Members and each special meeting of Members. The notice must be sent at least ten (10) days but not more than ninety (90) days before such meeting; except that, in the case of a special meeting pursuant to a petition from the Members, notice of such special meeting shall be given to Members within twenty (20) days after receipt of such petition, and the special meeting must be held not less than thirty-five (35) nor more than one hundred fifty (150) days after the petition is received. The notice shall state the date, time, and place of the meeting, and in the case of a special meeting, shall state the purpose for the meeting. No business may be transacted at a special meeting except as stated in the notice. 2.14 Record Dates.",
      "The Board may fix a date in the future as a record date for determining which Members are entitled to notice of any meeting of Members. The record date so fixed must be not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. If the Board does not fix a record date for notice to Members, the record date for notice is the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which notice is given. In addition, the Board may fix a date in the future as a record date for determining the Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members. The record date so fixed must be no more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. If the Board does not fix a record date for determining Members entitled to vote, Members on the day of the meeting who otherwise are eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the meeting. 2.15 Adjourned Meetings.",
      "If a quorum is not present at the time and place established for a meeting, a majority of the Members who are present, either in person or by written ballot, may adjourn the meeting to a time not less than five (5) nor more than thirty (30) days after the original meeting date, at which meeting the quorum requirement is the presence in person or by written ballot of Members holding at least ten (10 %) of the Association’s voting power. Adjourned meetings may be held without the notice required by these Bylaws if notice thereof is given by announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken. 2.16 Order of Business.

Security Deposit The Guidelines provide that major remodels require execution of a Security Deposit Agreement and a $2,500.00 security deposit to cover: (1) costs of restoration or repairs to common areas; (2) payment of any fines levied by the Association based on violations of the CC&R's or the Guidelines in conjunction with the construction of the proposed improvements; or (3) reimbursement for costs incurred by the Association in retaining a qualified consultant (e.g., an architect or engineer) to review plans and/or inspect the works of improvement. Any portion of the security deposit not utilized for (1) - (3) above will be returned to the homeowner applicant after completion of the proposed improvements. Starting immediately, the ECC will require that this Security Deposit Agreement and $2,500.00 security deposit be executed and paid with Architectural Applications except applications for projects in categories (1) through (4) on page 1. Approval of any Architectural Application requiring a Security Deposit Agreement and $2,500.00 security deposit will be expressly conditioned on the homeowner applicant's execution and delivery of the Security Deposit Agreement and $2,500.00 security deposit to the Community Manager. Indemnity and Maintenance Agreements; Restoration Agreements The Guidelines provide that, in addition to a security deposit, the ECC may require an indemnity or restoration agreement, with the cost of preparation and recording of the agreement to be borne by the homeowner applicant. In Paragraph 4 of the Security Deposit Agreement form (Form #3 2 Turtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association attached to the Guidelines) the homeowner applicant acknowledges that they may be required to execute a separate Indemnity Agreement with the Association providing for the future maintenance, repair, or replacement of the project improvements by the homeowner applicant or successor owners of the unit. Starting immediately, whenever any kind of indemnity, restoration or maintenance agreement is required as a condition of ECC approval of any application, the ECC will require that the required indemnity, restoration or maintenance agreement be executed by the homeowner applicant and on behalf of the Association, and recorded, prior to the ECC approval of such application being effective, and until the required indemnity, restoration or maintenance agreement be executed by the homeowner applicant and on behalf of the Association, and recorded, the application shall be deemed not approved.

      "Turtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association Architectural Application Process Revised January 12, 2024 The TRCMA ECC wants to begin more consistent in enforcing the provisions of the current TRCMA Architectural Guidelines (\"the Guidelines\") pertaining to submission of plans, application fees, security deposits and Indemnity, Maintenance and Restoration Agreements. Plans The Guidelines require a homeowner applicant to submit with an application three (3) sets of plans, and that the plans must be prepared in accordance with applicable building codes, with clarity and completeness. After action by the ECC, approved plans are to be distributed: one set to the Association's files and two sets to the homeowner, one of which is required to be maintained at the work site during the course of construction until final inspection of the completed project has been made by the ECC or its representative.",
      "If an application is disapproved the plans submitted with the application are to be returned to the homeowner applicant and included with any resubmittal of the application. Clearly, the plan submission requirements of the Guidelines contemplate printed hard copies of plans, as opposed to digital submissions. For the last several months, the ECC has received and accepted digital submissions which have included only digital plans, partial plans, and in some cases, no plans or design specifications. This has created a variety of difficulties. To correct this situation, starting immediately, consistently with the Guidelines, three (3) sets (printed hard copies) of complete plans depicting the full scope of work the homeowner applicant proposes will be required to be submitted with all Architectural Applications. The complete plans submitted should be no smaller than 11\" x 17\".",
      "The only exceptions to this requirement will be: (1) window replacements (including sliders and French doors), where the homeowner is simply replacing existing windows with new windows of the same size and dimensions, and not proposing to add or delete any windows. In these cases, photographic exhibits showing the locations of the proposed replacements and a product tear sheet or sheets with details of the proposed replacement windows must be submitted; (2) front door and sidelight replacements. In these cases, photographic exhibits showing the locations of the proposed replacements and a product tear sheet or sheets with details of the proposed replacement door and sidelights must be submitted; (3) garage door and exterior awning replacements.",
      "In these cases, a product tear sheet or sheets with details of the proposed replacement door or awning (as applicable) must be submitted; and (4) applications for projects for which the stated scope of work is so obviously de minimis that requiring preparation of complete plans would be unreasonable. These cases will be determined in the discretion of the ECC. In these cases, a written description of the complete proposed scope of work and simple drawings or photographic exhibits depicting the proposed project will be required. 1 Turtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association Any Architectural Application submitted that does not include the required plans will be deemed incomplete and returned to the homeowner applicant. Going forward, Keystone Architectural should respond to non-complying submissions accordingly, and should not forward them to the ECC until the required plans have been submitted with the application.",
      "Application Fee The Guidelines require a $2,500.00 application fee for \"major remodels\" to cover the Association's cost of consultants and potential legal opinions. \"Major remodels\" is not well-defined in the Guidelines, but stated exclusions are window replacements, garage door replacements and \"minor remodels,\" which term is not defined. Any portion of the $2,500.00 remaining after the ECC has made its decision on the application is refunded to the homeowner or applied toward the security deposit (see below). Starting immediately, the ECC will require that this $2,500.00 application fee be submitted with all Architectural Applications except applications for projects in categories (1) through (4) above. Any Architectural Application submitted without the required $2,500.00 application fee will be deemed incomplete and returned to the homeowner applicant.",

No such sale or\ntransfer shall relieve such Condominium or the purchaser thereof from liability for any\nAssessments thereafter becoming due or from the lien thereof.\n\n4.14.

In such event, the Association\nshall prepare, execute and Record, as promptly as practical, the certificate stating that a\nmajority of the Board may properly exercise an irrevocable power of attorney to sell the\nProject for the benefit of the Owners and execute such other documents and\ninstruments as may be necessary for the Association to consummate the sale of the\nProject at the highest and best price obtainable, either in its damaged condition or after\ndamaged structures have been razed. Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of\nsuch authority for any Person relying thereon in good faith. The net proceeds of such\nsale and the proceeds of any insurance carried by the Association shall be divided\nproportionately among the Owners, such proportions to be determined in accordance\nwith the relative appraised fair market valuation of the Condominiums as of a date\n\n-41-\n\nAmended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025\n\nimmediately before such destruction (or condemnation), expressed as percentages, and\ncomputed by dividing such appraised valuation of each Condominium by the total of\nsuch appraised valuations of all Condominiums in the Project. The Board is authorized\nto hire one (1) or more appraisers for such a purpose, and the cost of such appraisals\nshall be a Common Expense. However, the balance then due on any valid Mortgage\nshall be paid first in order of priority before the distribution of proceeds to an Owner\nwhose Condominium is so encumbered. Nothing in this Declaration prevents the\npartition of a co-tenancy in any Condominium. Except as provided above, each Owner\nand the successors of each Owner, whether by deed, gift, devise or operation of law, for\ntheir own benefit and for the Condominiums and for the benefit of all other Owners,\nspecifically waive and abandon all rights, interests and causes of action for a judicial\npartition of the tenancy in common ownership of the Project and covenant that no action\nfor such judicial partition shall be instituted, prosecuted or reduced to judgment.\n\n9.3.

If the restoration is accomplished at a cost less than the amount of\nthe condemnation awards, then that portion of the condemnation awards that exceeds\nthe restoration costs shall be paid to the Owners of the partially taken Units in\nproportion to the decrease in the fair market value of their Condominiums; however,\nsuch awards shall be applied first to the balance then due on Mortgages encumbering\nsuch Owners’ Condominiums, in order of priority.\n\n10.5.2. Minor Takings Exceeding Limits.\nIf (a) there is a taking of a portion of one (1) or more Units that does not substantially\nand adversely affect the Units’ ability to serve as residences, and (b) restoration cannot\nbe accomplished at a cost less than or equal to the Allowable Cost, then the Board shall\n-43-\n\nAmended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025\n\nhold a special election of the Owners.

If a Condominium is owned jointly by two (2) or more Persons, the liability\nof each Owner in connection with the obligations imposed by the Governing Documents\nshall be joint and several; that is, each co-Owner individually shall be fully liable and\nresponsible and all co-Owners collectively shall be fully liable and responsible.\n\n12.1.2. Violations as Nuisance.\n\nEvery act or omission constituting or resulting in a violation of any of the provisions of\nthe Governing Documents shall be deemed to constitute a nuisance and, in addition to\nany other remedies which may be available, such nuisance may be abated or enjoined\nby the Association or its officers or Board of Directors or by any Owner; provided,\nhowever, that the Board shall not be obligated to take action to abate or enjoin a\nparticular violation if, in the exercise of its discretion, the Board determines that acting to\nabate or enjoin such violation is not likely to foster or protect the interests of the\nAssociation and its Members as a whole. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and\n\n-47-\n\nAmended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025\n\nwithout limiting the generality of the conditions therein, nothing in the Governing\nDocuments shall be deemed to impose upon the Association, the Board, or the officers,\nemployees, or agents of the Association a duty to intervene in any physical dispute or\naltercation or any criminal or alleged criminal activity other than to notify law\nenforcement officials.\n\n12.1.3. Violations of Law.\n\nAny violation of a state, municipal, or local law, ordinance or regulation pertaining to the\nownership, occupancy, or use of any property within the Project is hereby declared to\nbe a violation of this Declaration and subject to any and all of the enforcement\nprocedures set forth herein.\n\n12.1.4.

Each Owner has a right of action against the\nAssociation for the Association’s failure to comply with the Governing Documents. Each\nremedy provided for in this Declaration is cumulative and not exclusive or exhaustive.\n\n12.2. Nonpayment of Assessments.\n\n12.2.1. Delinquency.\nAssessments are delinquent if not paid within fifteen (15) days after the due date\nestablished by the Association. The Association may require the delinquent Owner to\npay a late charge in accordance with Section 5650(b)(2) of the Civil Code. Assessments\nnot paid within thirty (30) days after the due date, plus all reasonable fees and costs of\ncollection (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and late charges, bear interest at the\n\n-48-\n\nAmended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025\n\nmaximum rate permitted by law commencing thirty (30) days after the due date until\npaid. All Assessments, late charges, reasonable fees and costs of collection,\nreasonable attorneys’ fees, and interest shall be a debt of the Owner at the time the\nAssessments or other sums are levied. Payments made by an Owner shall be applied\nfirst to the Assessments owed and, only after the Assessments owed are paid in full,\nshall be applied to accumulated fees and costs of collection, attorneys’ fees, late\ncharges, or interest. The Association shall provide a mailing address for overnight\npayment of Assessments.\n\n12.2.2. Creation and Release of Lien.\n\n(a) Priority of Lien. All liens levied in accordance with this\nDeclaration shall be prior and superior to (i) any declaration of homestead Recorded after\nthe recordation of this Declaration and (ii) all other liens, except (A) all taxes, bonds,\nassessments and other levies that, by law, would be superior thereto and (B) the lien or\ncharge of any first Mortgage of Record (meaning any Recorded Mortgage with first priority\nor seniority over other Mortgages) made in good faith and for value and Recorded before\nthe date on which the Notice of Delinquent Assessment (as defined in this Section)\nagainst the assessed Condominium was Recorded.\n\n(b) Prerequisites to Creating Lien. Before the Association may\nplace a lien on an Owner's Condominium to collect a past due Assessment or other debt\nthat is past due, the Association shall do all of the following:\n\n(i) At least thirty (30) days before Recording a lien for\ndelinquent Assessments, the Association shall send by certified mail to the delinquent\nOwner a written notice (“Notice of Intent to Lien”) that contains all of the information\nrequired by Civil Code Section 5660.\n\n(ii) | The Association shall offer such Owner and, if so\nrequested by such Owner, shall participate in internal dispute resolution to the extent\nrequired pursuant to Civil Code section 5673.\n\n(c) Owner’s Right to Request Meeting; Payment Plans. An\nOwner may submit a written request to meet with the Board to discuss a payment plan\n\nfor the debt set forth in the Notice of Intent to Lien and the Association shall provide the\nrequesting Owner with any standards for payment plans. The Board shall meet with such\nOwner in executive session within forty-five (45) days of the postmark of such Owner's\nwritten request if such request is mailed within fifteen (15) days of the date of the postmark\nof the Notice of Intent to Lien, unless there is no regularly-scheduled Board meeting within\nsuch period, in which case the Board may designate a committee of one (1) or more\nmembers to meet with such Owner. A payment plan may incorporate any and all\nAssessments that accrue during the payment plan period. A payment plan shall not\nimpede the Association’s ability to Record a lien on an Owner's Condominium to secure\npayment of delinquent Assessments. Additional late fees shall not accrue during the\npayment plan period if the Owner is in compliance with the terms of the payment plan. In\n\n-49-\n\nAmended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025\n\nthe event of a default on any payment plan, the Association may resume its efforts to\ncollect the delinquent Assessments from the time before entering into the payment plan.\n\n(d) Notice of Delinquent Assessment. The lien becomes\neffective upon recordation of a Notice of Delinquent Assessment (“Notice of Delinquent\n\nAssessment”) securing the payment of any Assessment or installment thereof levied by\nthe Association against any Owner, as provided in Civil Code section 5675. An itemized\nstatement shall be Recorded together with the Notice of Delinquent Assessment. The\nNotice of Delinquent Assessment must identify (i) the amount of the Assessment and\nother authorized charges and interest, including the cost of preparing and Recording the\nNotice of Delinquent Assessment, (ii) the amount of collection costs incurred, including\nreasonable attorneys’ fees, (iii) a sufficient description of the Condominium that has been\nassessed, (iv) the Association’s name and address, (v) the name of the Owner of the\nCondominium that has been assessed and (vi) if the lien is to be enforced by nonjudicial\nforeclosure, the name and address of the trustee authorized by the Association to enforce\nthe lien by sale. The Notice of Delinquent Assessment must be signed by an authorized\nAssociation officer or agent. A copy of the Recorded Notice of Delinquent Assessment\nshall be mailed by certified mail to every Person whose name is shown as an Owner of\nthe Condominium in the Association’s records no later than ten (10) calendar days after\nRecordation. The lien relates only to the individual Condominium against which the\nAssessment was levied and not to the Project as a whole.\n\n(e) Decision to Record Lien. The decision to Record a lien for\ndelinquent Assessments shall be made only by the Board and may not be delegated to\nan agent of the Association. The Board shall approve the decision by a majority vote of\nthe Directors in an open meeting of the Board. The Board shall record the vote in the\nminutes of that meeting.\n\n(f) Exceptions. Pursuant to Civil Code Section 5725\\(b),\nEnforcement Assessments may not become a lien against an Owner's Condominium\nenforceable by trustee’s sale of such Condominium under Sections 2924, 2924b and\n2924c of the Civil Code.\n\n(g) Release of Lien. Upon payment of the full amount claimed in\nthe Notice of Delinquent Assessment or other satisfaction thereof, the Board shall cause\nto be Recorded a Notice of Satisfaction and Release of Lien (the “Notice of Release”)\nstating the satisfaction and release of the amount claimed. The Board may require the\nOwner to pay a reasonable charge for preparing and Recording the Notice of Release.\nAny purchaser or encumbrancer who has acted in good faith and extended value may\nrely on the Notice of Release as conclusive evidence of the full satisfaction of the sums\nidentified as owed in the Notice of Delinquent Assessment.\n\n12.2.3. Enforcement of Liens.\n\nThe Board shall enforce the collection of amounts due under this Declaration by one (1)\nor more of the alternative means of relief afforded by this Declaration. The lien on a\nCondominium may be enforced by foreclosure and sale of the Condominium after failure\nof the Owner to pay any Assessment, or installment thereof, as provided in this\n\n-50-\n\nAmended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025\n\nDeclaration. The sale shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Civil\nCode applicable to the exercise of powers of sale in Mortgages or in any manner\npermitted by law, including sale by the court, sale by the trustee designated in the Notice\nof Delinquent Assessment or sale by a trustee substituted pursuant to Section 2934a of\nthe Civil Code. Any sale by the trustee shall be conducted in accordance with Sections\n2924, 2924b and 2924c of the Civil Code applicable to the exercise of powers of sale in\nmortgages and deeds of trusts, and the fees of a trustee may not exceed the amounts\nprescribed in Sections 2924c and 2924d of the Civil Code. In addition to the requirements\nof Section 2924 of the Civil Code, the Association shall serve a Notice of Delinquent\nAssessment on the Owner’s legal representative in accordance with the manner of\nservice of summons in Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10) of Chapter 4 of Title\n5 of Part 2 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The Owner’s legal representative\nshall be the Person whose name is shown as the Owner of such Owner’s Condominium\nin the Association’s records, unless another Person has been previously designated by\nsuch Owner as such Owner's legal representative in writing and mailed to the Association\nin a manner that indicates that the Association has received it.\n\nSubject to the provisions of Section 12.3, the Association may sue to foreclose the lien if\n(i) at least thirty (80) days have elapsed since the date on which the Notice of Delinquent\nAssessment was Recorded and (ii) at least ten (10) days have elapsed since a copy of\nthe Notice of Delinquent Assessment was mailed by certified mail to every Person whose\nname is shown in the Association’s records as an Owner of the Condominium affected\nthereby. The Association may bid on the Condominium at foreclosure sale and acquire\nand hold, lease, mortgage and convey the Condominium. Upon completion of the\nforeclosure sale, the Association or the purchaser at the sale may file suit to secure\noccupancy of the defaulting Owner’s Condominium, and the defaulting Owner shall be\nrequired to pay the reasonable rental value for the Condominium during any period of\ncontinued occupancy by the defaulting Owner or any Person claiming under the defaulting\nOwner. A suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid Assessments may be brought\nwithout foreclosing or waiving any lien securing the obligation to pay such Assessments,\nbut this provision or any suit to recover a money judgment does not affirm the adequacy\nof money damages. Any recovery resulting from a suit at law or in equity initiated pursuant\nto this Section may include reasonable attorneys’ fees as fixed by the court.\n\n12.2.4. Priority of Assessment Lien.\n\nMortgages Recorded before a Notice of Delinquent Assessment have lien priority over\nthe Notice of Delinquent Assessment. The sale or transfer of any Condominium does not\naffect the Assessment lien, except that the sale or transfer of any Condominium pursuant\nto judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of a first Mortgage extinguishes the lien of such\nAssessment as to payments that became due before such sale or transfer. No sale or\ntransfer relieves such Condominium from liens for any Assessment thereafter becoming\ndue. No Person who obtains title to a Condominium pursuant to a judicial or nonjudicial\nforeclosure of the first Mortgage is liable for the share of the Common Expenses or\nAssessments chargeable to such Condominium that became due before the acquisition\nof title to the Condominium by such Person. Such unpaid share of Common Expenses or\nAssessments is a Common Expense collectible from all Owners, including such Person.\n\n-51-\n\nAmended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025\n\nThe Association may take such action as is necessary to make any Assessment lien\nsubordinate to the interests of the Department of Veterans Affairs of the State of California\nunder its Cal-Vet loan contracts as if the Cal-Vet loan contracts were first Mortgages of\nRecord.\n\n12.2.5. Alternative Dispute Resolution.\n\nBefore initiating a foreclosure for any delinquent Assessment, the Association shall offer\nthe Owner and, if so requested by the Owner, shall participate in internal dispute\nresolution or alternative dispute resolution with a neutral third party pursuant to Section\n5660 of the Civil Code. The decision to pursue dispute resolution shall be the choice of\nthe Owner, except that binding arbitration shall not be available if the Association intends\nto initiate a judicial foreclosure.\n\n12.2.6. Secondary Addresses of Owners.\n\nUpon receipt of a written request by an Owner identifying a secondary address for\npurposes of collection notices, the Association shall send additional copies of any and all\nnotices required by this Section 12.2 to the secondary address provided. The Association\nshall notify Owners of their right to submit secondary addresses to the Association, at the\ntime the Association issues the annual Budget. Each Owner’s request shall be in writing\nand shall be mailed to the Association in a manner that shall indicate the Association has\nreceived it. Any Owner may identify or change a secondary address at any time; provided\nthat, if a secondary address is identified or changed during the collection process, the\nAssociation shall only be required to send notices to the indicated secondary address\nfrom the point the Association receives the request.\n\n12.2.7. Receivers.\n\nIn addition to the foreclosure and other remedies granted to the Association in this\nDeclaration, each Owner, by acceptance of a deed to such Owner’s Condominium,\nconveys to the Association all of such Owner's right, title and interest in all rents, issues\nand profits derived from and appurtenant to such Condominium, subject to the right of the\nAssociation to collect and apply such rents, issues and profits to delinquent Assessments\nowed by such Owner, reserving to such Owner the right, before any default by such\nOwner in the payment of Assessments, to collect and retain such rents, issues and profits\nas they may become due and payable. Upon any such default, the Association may, upon\nthe expiration of thirty (80) days following delivery to the Owner of the Notice of Delinquent\nAssessment described in this Declaration, either in person, by agent or by receiver to be\nappointed by a court, and without regard to the adequacy of any security for the\nindebtedness secured by the lien described in this Declaration, (a) enter in or on and take\npossession of the Condominium or any part thereof, (b) in the Association’s name, sue\nfor or otherwise collect such rents, issues and profits, including those past due and\nunpaid, and (c) apply the same, less allowable expenses of operation, to any delinquency\nof such Owner and in such order as the Association may determine. The entering upon\nand taking possession of the Condominium, the collection of rents, issues and profits and\nthe application thereof shall not cure or waive any default or notice of default under this\nDeclaration or invalidate any act done pursuant to such notice.\n\n-52-\n\nAmended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025\n\n12.3. Collection of Delinquent Assessments Through Foreclosure.\n\nThe Association is authorized to collect delinquent Assessments through an action at law\nor by judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure or by any other means authorized by Applicable\nLaw.\n\nARTICLE Xill - DURATION AND AMENDMENT\n\n13.1.

Easements. 2.7.1. Easements Generally. In addition to all easements reserved and granted on the Subdivision Map or the Condominium Plan, easements set forth in this Declaration shall be appurtenant to, and shall pass with the title to, each Condominium and shall be subordinate to any exclusive easements granted elsewhere in this Declaration, to the right of the Association to perform its obligations under this Declaration, or to otherwise regulate the Common Area as provided in the Governing Documents. Each of the easements reserved or granted herein shall be covenants running with the land for the use and benefit of the Owners and their Condominiums superior to all other encumbrances applied against or in favor of any portion of the Project.

Each Owner shall have a nonexclusive easement for use and enjoyment of the Common Area in the Lot in which his or her Condominium is located as well as a nonexclusive easement for vehicular and pedestrian use and access over the streets and walkways in other Common Area throughout the Project; provided, however, such nonexclusive easements shall be subordinate to, and shall not interfere with, the exclusive easements, if any, appurtenant to Units over Exclusive Use Common Area. 2.7.4. Encroachment Easements. None of the rights and obligations of the Owners created herein shall be altered in any way by encroachments due to settlement or shifting of structures or any other cause. There shall be valid easements for the maintenance of such encroachments over the -9- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 Common Area or Condominiums upon which the encroachment exists so long as the encroachments shall exist; provided, however, that in no event shall a valid easement for encroachment be created in favor of an Owner if said encroachment occurred due to the willful conduct of said Owner. In the event a Condominium is partially or totally destroyed and then rebuilt or repaired, the Owners of any adjoining Condominiums agree that any minor encroachments over the adjoining Condominiums, which are similar to any encroachments that existed prior to the partial or total destruction shall be permitted and there shall be easements for maintenance of such encroachment so long as they shall exist. 2.7.5. Owners’ Shared Utility Easements. Wherever sanitary sewer house connections and/or water house connections or electricity, cable TV, gas, or telephone lines are installed within the Project, which connections serve more than one Condominium, the Owner of each Condominium served by said connections shall be entitled to the full use and enjoyment of such portions of said connections as servicing his or her Condominium and the Owner of any Unit served by such connections shall have the right, and is hereby granted an easement to the full extent necessary therefor, to enter upon a Condominium or Common Area or to have the utility companies enter upon a Condominium or Common Area in or upon which said connections, or any portion thereof, lies, to repair, replace and generally maintain said connections as and when necessary. 2.8.

ARTICLE Ill —- THE ASSOCIATION 3.1. Organization of the Association. The Association is incorporated as a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation under the California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law. The Association has the powers and duties listed in the Governing Documents and also has the general and implied powers of a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation generally to do all things that a corporation organized under the laws of the State of California may lawfully do that are necessary or proper for the obligations and duties imposed upon it, subject only to the limits on the exercise of such powers as set forth in Applicable Law and the Governing Documents. -10- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 3.2. Board of Directors. The affairs of the Association shall be managed, and its duties and obligations performed by, the Board of Directors unless otherwise indicated in the Governing Documents or Applicable Law. 3.3. Legal Standing to Resolve Disputes. To the fullest extent permitted by law, including Civil Code section 5980, the Association shall have standing to institute, defend, settle, or intervene in litigation, arbitration, mediation, or administrative proceedings in its own name as a real party in interest, and without joining with it the Owners, in matters pertaining to the following: (a) enforcement of the Governing Documents; damage to the Common Area; damage to the separate interests that the Association is obligated to maintain, repair, or replace; damage to a separate interest that arises out of, or is integrally related to, damage to the Common Area or separate interests that the Association is obligated to maintain, repair, or replace. 3.4. Membership. 3.4.1. Generally. Every Owner of a Condominium shall automatically acquire a Membership in the Association and retain such Membership until such time Owner’s Condominium ownership ceases, at which time such Owner’s Membership shall automatically cease. Ownership of a Condominium is the sole qualification for Membership. Memberships are not assignable except to the Person to whom title to the Condominium is transferred, and every Membership is appurtenant to, and may not be separated from, the fee ownership of such Condominium. The rights, duties, privileges, and obligations of all Owners are as provided in the Governing Documents. 3.4.2. Transfer. The Membership of any Owner may not be transferred, pledged, or alienated in any way, except upon the transfer of ownership to the Owner’s Condominium and then only to the transferee of such Condominium. A prohibited transfer is void and will not be reflected in the records of the Association. Any Owner who has sold a Condominium to a contract purchaser under an agreement to purchase may delegate such Owner's Membership rights to such contract purchaser. Such delegation must be in writing and must be delivered to the Association before the contract purchaser may vote. The contract seller shall remain liable for all charges and Assessments attributable to such contract seller’s Condominium that accrue before title to the Condominium is transferred. If an Owner fails or refuses to transfer such Owner’s Membership to the purchaser of such Owner’s Condominium upon transfer of title thereto, then the Association may record the transfer in the Association’s records. Until satisfactory evidence of such transfer is presented to the Association, the purchaser will not be entitled to vote on Association matters. The Association may levy a reasonable transfer fee against a new Owner and such new Owner’s Condominium (which fee shall be paid through escrow or added to the Annual Assessment chargeable to such new Owner) to reimburse the Association for the administrative cost of transferring the Membership to -11- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 such new Owner on the Association’s records. Such fee may not exceed the Association’s actual cost involved in changing its records. 3.4.3. Classes of Membership. The Association has one class of Membership. Members are entitled to one (1) vote for each Condominium owned. The vote for each Condominium shall be exercised in accordance with the Governing Documents, but no more than one (1) vote may be cast for any Condominium. ARTICLE IV— ASSESSMENTS AND ASSOCIATION MAINTENANCE FUNDS 4.1. Personal Obligation to Pay Assessments. Each Owner covenants to pay to the Association Assessments established and collected pursuant to this Declaration. The Association shall not levy or collect any Assessment that exceeds the amount necessary for the purpose for which it is levied. Each Assessment, together with late payment penalties, interest, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees for the collection thereof, is a charge and a continuing lien on the Condominium against which such Assessment is made. Each Assessment, together with late payment penalties, interest, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees, is also the personal obligation of the Owner of the Condominium at the time the Assessment accrued. The personal obligation for delinquent Assessments may not pass to any new Owner (the “Purchaser’) unless expressly assumed by the Purchaser or unless the Purchaser has actual or constructive knowledge of such delinquent Assessments, whether by virtue of the Recordation of a Notice of Delinquent Assessment or receipt from the Association of a certificate pursuant to Section 5675 of the Civil Code. 4.2. Association Maintenance Funds. The Association shall establish no fewer than two (2) separate Association Maintenance Fund accounts into which shall be deposited all money paid to the Association and from which disbursements shall be made, as provided in this Declaration. The Association Maintenance Funds may be established as trust accounts at a banking or savings institution and shall include an operating fund for current Common Expenses (the “Operating Fund”); an adequate reserve fund (the “Reserve Fund”) for the portion of Common Expenses allocated to reserves for the maintenance of Improvements that the Board does not expect to perform on an annual or more frequent basis and payment of deductible amounts for insurance policies that the Association obtains; and all other funds that the Association may establish. 4.3. Purposes of Assessments and Association Maintenance Funds. The Assessments shall be used exclusively to promote recreation, health, safety, and welfare of the Owners and Residents; to operate, improve, and maintain the Common Area; and discharge all other Association obligations under this Declaration. All amounts deposited into the Association Maintenance Funds must be used solely for the common benefit of all Owners for purposes authorized by this Declaration. Disbursements from the Operating Fund shall be made by the Association for such purposes as are necessary for the discharge of the Association’s obligations under this -12- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 Declaration for the common benefit of all Owners, other than those purposes for which disbursements from the Reserve Fund are to be used. Disbursements from the Reserve Fund shall be made by the Association only for the purposes specified in this Article and in Section 5510(b) of the Civil Code; provided, however, that the Board may authorize the temporary transfer of moneys from the Reserve Fund to the Operating Fund to meet short-term cash flow requirements or other expenses pursuant to Section 5515 of the Civil Code. 4.4. Waiver of Use. No Owner is exempt from personal liability for Assessments duly levied by the Association nor may any Owner release his or her Condominium from the liens and charges thereof by waiving use and enjoyment of the Common Area or by abandoning his or her Condominium. 4.5. Annual Assessments. The estimated funds needed to meet the annual Common Expenses of the Association shall be assessed to each Condominium on a uniform basis as an Annual Assessment. Each Owner is obligated to pay Annual Assessments to the Association in monthly installments on or before the first day of each month unless the Board adopts an alternative method for payment. 4.6. Limitations on Annual Assessment Increases. 4.6.1. Maximum Authorized Annual Assessment. The Board may levy Annual Assessments that exceed the Annual Assessments for the immediately-preceding Fiscal Year only as follows: (a) if the increase in Annual Assessments is less than or equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Annual Assessments for the immediately-preceding Fiscal Year, then the Board must either (i) have complied with applicable provisions of subdivision (b) of Section 5300 of the Civil Code for the fiscal year or (ii) obtain the approval of Owners casting a majority of votes in an election of the Association in which more than fifty percent (50%) of the Condominiums are represented (“Increase Election”), and (b) if the increase in Annual Assessments is greater than twenty percent (20%) of the Annual Assessments for the immediately- preceding Fiscal Year, then the Board must obtain the approval of Owners casting a majority of votes in an Increase Election. This Section does not limit Annual Assessment increases necessary for addressing an Emergency Situation (as defined in Section 4.6.3 below). 4.6.2. Revised Annual Assessments. Subject to the limitations stated in Section 4.6.1 above or as otherwise permitted by law, if the Board determines that the amount to be collected from Annual Assessments will be inadequate to defray the Common Expenses for the year due to the cost of any construction or unexpected maintenance of components in Common Area or any other reason, the Association may revise the Annual Assessment for the remainder of the Fiscal Year to cover the expense. -13- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 4.6.3. Emergency Situations. An “Emergency Situation” is any one of the following: (a) an extraordinary expense required by a court order; (b) an extraordinary expense necessary to maintain a portion of the Project for which the Association is responsible where a threat to personal safety is discovered; and (c) an extraordinary expense necessary to maintain the portion of the Project for which the Association is responsible that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the Board when preparing the Budget. Before imposing or collecting an Assessment pursuant to this subparagraph, the Board shall adopt a resolution containing written findings regarding the necessity of the extraordinary expense involved and why such expense was not or could not have been reasonably foreseen in the budgeting process. Such resolution shall be distributed to the Owners with the notice of the Assessment. 4.7. Allocation of Annual Assessments. Annual Assessments shall be assessed uniformly and equally against the Owners and their Condominiums based on the number of Condominiums owned by each Owner. The Board shall fix the amount of the Annual Assessment against each Condominium at least thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of each Fiscal Year. Written notice of any increase in the amount of an Annual Assessment shall be sent via first-class mail to every Owner subject thereto not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days before the increased Annual Assessment becomes due. The Board has the power to require that funds in the Operating Fund at the end of the Fiscal Year be retained and used to reduce the following Fiscal Year’s Annual Assessments. Upon dissolution of the Association incident to the abandonment or termination of the Project as a condominium project, all amounts remaining in any of the Association Maintenance Funds shall be distributed to or for the benefit of the Owners in the same proportions as such money was collected from the Owners. Each Owner shall pay Annual Assessments in installments at such frequency and in such amounts and by such methods as are established by the Board. If the Association incurs additional expenses because of a payment method selected by an Owner, then the Association may charge such additional expenses to such Owner. The Association does not have to apportion such additional expenses among all Owners as a part of Annual Assessments. 4.8. Special Assessments. The Board may levy, in any Fiscal Year, a Special Assessment applicable to such Fiscal Year only to defray, in whole or in part, the cost of any construction, repair, or replacement of Improvements or other such addition to the Common Area or as otherwise determined necessary by the Board. No Special Assessment in any Fiscal Year, if added to the Special Assessments already levied during such Fiscal Year, may exceed five percent (5%) of the Association’s budgeted gross expenses for such Fiscal Year without the vote or written consent of Owners casting a majority of votes at an Increase Election. The Board may levy, in any Fiscal Year, a Special Assessment applicable to such Fiscal Year that exceeds five percent (5%) of the Association’s -14- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 budgeted gross expenses for such Fiscal Year if such increase is necessary for addressing an Emergency Situation as defined in Section 4.6.3. Special Assessments shall be levied and collected in the same manner as Regular Assessments, except in those circumstances where Special Assessments are made for the purpose of rebuilding after a catastrophic event, in which case the Special Assessment shall be levied upon the basis of the ratio of the square footage of the floor area of the Unit to be assessed to the total square footage of floor area of all Units to be assessed. 4.9. Reimbursement Assessments. The Board, after Notice and Hearing, may levy a Reimbursement Assessment against an Owner and his or her Condominium to reimburse the Association for the costs incurred by the Association to: (a) maintain, repair or replace property (including property within a Unit) when such damage is due to the act or negligence of such Owner, or member of his or her household, pet, Tenant, invitee, or Guest or as otherwise provided in the Governing Documents; (b) remedy a lack of compliance with any provision of the Governing Documents by an Owner or his or her Condominium, or his or her Family, pet, Tenant, invitee, or Guest; or (c) collect from an Owner any amount owed to the Association. 4.10. Enforcement Assessments. The Board, after Notice and Hearing, may levy an Enforcement Assessment against an Owner (and any fine or monetary penalty imposed by the Board in accordance with the Governing Documents shall be deemed to be an Enforcement Assessment), for violation of any of the provisions of the Governing Documents. Duly-levied Enforcement Assessments shall be subject to the provisions in the Governing Documents regarding costs, late charges, and interest for delinquent payment, and may become a lien on the Condominium collectible by the Association only through judicial foreclosure. 4.11. No Offsets. All Assessments shall be payable in the amounts specified by the Association, and no offsets against such amount shall be permitted for any reason, including, without limitation, a claim that the Association is not properly exercising its duties of operation, maintenance, or enforcement. 4.12. Enforcement of Assessments and Late Charges. The Board, on behalf of the Association, may enforce the payment of any delinquent Assessment plus related late charges, reasonable costs of collection (including attorneys’ fees), and interest by bringing an action at law against an Owner personally obligated to pay, or by foreclosing a lien against the Owner’s Condominium by judicial or non-judicial foreclosure to the fullest extent permitted by law. A delinquent Assessment, and any related late charges, reasonable costs of collection (including attorneys’ fees), and interest assessed in accordance with Section 12.2 of this Declaration and Applicable Law, shall become a lien upon the Condominium when a Notice of Delinquent Assessment is duly Recorded as provided in Applicable Law. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the Notice of Delinquent Assessment shall describe the amount of the delinquent -15- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 Assessment or installment, the related charges authorized by this Declaration, the legal description of the Condominium, the name of the purported Owner, and, if the lien Is to be enforced by power of sale under nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings, the name and address of the trustee authorized by the Association to enforce the lien by sale. The Notice of Delinquent Assessment may be signed by any officer or director of the Association, or any employee or agent of the Association authorized to do so by the Board. The Notice of Delinquent Assessment shall be mailed by certified mail or overnight delivery with proof of same to every Person whose name is shown as an Owner of the Condominium in the Association's records, and the Notice of Delinquent Assessment shall be sent no later than ten (10) calendar days after recordation. Unless otherwise allowed by Applicable Law, the Notice of Delinquent Assessment may not be recorded until after the Association has sent the written demand for payment to the delinquent Owner by certified mail or overnight delivery with proof of same. The written demand shall comply with the requirements of Applicable Law. If not paid in full within thirty (30) days after recordation of the Notice of Delinquent Assessment, any lien described herein may be enforced in any manner permitted by Applicable Law, including judicial foreclosure or nonjudicial foreclosure. Any nonjudicial foreclosure shall be conducted by the trustee named in the Notice of Delinquent Assessment or by a trustee substituted pursuant to Applicable Law. 4.13. Subordination to First Mortgage Lien. The lien securing any of the Assessments provided for in this Declaration shall be prior to all encumbrances made by an Owner or imposed by legal process upon any Condominium except taxes, bonds, assessments and other levies, which, by law, are prior thereto, whether the notice of assessment is recorded prior or subsequent to any such encumbrances, except that the lien of the Assessments shall be subordinate to the lien of any first Mortgage, provided such first Mortgage is made in good faith and for value and recorded in the Official Records of the County prior to the recordation of a claim of lien for said Assessments. Sale or transfer of any Condominium shall not defeat or affect the Assessment lien. However, the sale or transfer of any Condominium which is subject to any first Mortgage, pursuant to a foreclosure under such first Mortgage shall extinguish the lien of such Assessment as to payments thereof which became due prior to such sale or transfer, except for the amount of unpaid Assessments specified in a Claim of lien recorded prior to the recordation of such first Mortgage. No such sale or transfer shall relieve such Condominium or the purchaser thereof from liability for any Assessments thereafter becoming due or from the lien thereof. 4.14. Assignment of Rents. As security for the payment of all liens provided for under this Declaration, each Owner grants to the Association a present security interest in existing and future leases, rents, issues, or profits of the Owner’s Condominium.

Any damage caused to a Unit by such entry by the Association or by any Person authorized by the Association shall be repaired by the Association as a Common Expense. All costs involved in operating the inspection and preventive program on Common Area as well as repairing and replacing Common Area and Improvements thereon when the need for such maintenance, repair, or replacement is the result of wood-destroying pests or organisms are a Common Expense. The Association is not responsible for paying for any Pest Eradication effort that must be performed in connection with the transfer of any Condominium in the Project or that is ordered by any individual Owner. Those costs are the Owner's responsibility even if -29- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 those costs involve repairs to Common Area that are not otherwise the responsibility of such Owner. 6.5. Ambiguities in Assignment of Maintenance Obligations. If there are differing opinions regarding responsibility for a particular item (i.e., between two or more Owners or between the Association and one or more Owners), the responsibility for its maintenance, repair, and replacement shall be as determined by the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, unless otherwise addressed by Applicable Law. Any resolution of an ambiguity pursuant to this Section shall be binding on the Association and all Owners. ARTICLE VII - ARCHITECTURAL CONTROL 7.1. General. In addition to the architectural control established in the Master Declaration and compliance with its Architectural Committee, each Owner must comply with the provisions of this Article regarding architectural control established by this Declaration. Accordingly, any construction, installation, change, modification, revision, addition, or Improvement (collectively “Alteration”) to the exterior of a Unit or Exclusive Use Common Area, including landscaping, or structural alterations to a Unit or Exclusive Use Common Area, shall be governed by this Article. Alterations to Common Area by the Association need not comply with the requirements of this Article. The powers and duties set forth in this Article shall be vested in, and exercised by, the Board. The Board has the power, but not the duty, to establish an Architectural Review Committee (“ARC”) as provided herein to assist the Board in reviewing architectural submittals, and to provide recommendations to the Board with regard to approval or denial of any submittal. In the absence of an ARC, the Board shall perform the functions of the ARC. 7.2. Standard of Review. In engaging its architectural control responsibilities under this Article, the Board or ARC shall act in good faith, in accordance with Applicable Law, and not arbitrarily or capriciously. The Board or ARC shall approve plans and specifications submitted for its approval only if it determines that the proposed Alteration will not be detrimental to the appearance of the surrounding area of the Project as a whole and the appearance will be in harmony with the surrounding structures; the safety of any structure affected by the proposed Alteration will not be comprised; the proposed Alteration will not detract from the beauty, wholesomeness, and attractiveness of the Project or the enjoyment thereof by the Owners; maintenance of the proposed Alteration will not become a burden on the Association; and the proposed Alteration is consistent with this Declaration. A decision by the Board or ARC on a proposed Alteration may not violate any Applicable Law. Except as limited by the preceding sentence, the Board or ARC’s approval or denial shall be based solely on the considerations listed in this Article. The Board or ARC are not responsible for reviewing, nor may their approval of any plan or design be deemed the Board or ARC’s approval of, any plan or design from the -30- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 standpoint of engineering design, structural safety, conformance with building or other codes, compliance with the requirements of any utility company, compliance with any Recorded restriction or property right, or compliance with the Governing Documents. 7.3. Architectural Review Committee. If appointed by the Board, the ARC shall be composed of three (3) members, all appointed and removed by the Board. ARC members must be Members and directors may serve as ARC members. The term of each ARC member shall be a period of three (3) years or until the appointment of his or her successor. Any new ARC member appointed to replace a member who has died, resigned, or been removed shall serve for such member's unexpired term. 7.3.1. Appointment, Removal, and Resignation of the ARC. The right to appoint and remove ARC members is vested solely in the Board. Any ARC member may resign from the ARC at any time by giving written notice to the Board. The Board may appoint a successor. Vacancies on the ARC, however caused, shall be filled by vote of a majority of the Board members. Failure of the Board to fill any vacancy in the ARC shall not prevent any action by the ARC on any matter to the extent that a majority of the ARC joins in and consents to that action. 7.3.2. Duties. The ARC shall consider and act upon all proposals and plans submitted to it, including inspection of work in progress. The ARC shall also make all reasonable efforts to ensure that Alterations to Units or Exclusive Use Common Area made by Owners conform to plans approved by the Board. The ARC shall consult with the Master Association’s Architectural Committee, as needed, to ensure that its architectural control of the Project is consistent with the overall development and aesthetics of the Master Association. The Board shall exercise all available legal and equitable remedies to prevent or remove any unauthorized and unapproved construction or Improvements on the Project or any portion thereof. 7.3.3. Meetings and Compensation. The ARC shall meet from time to time as necessary to perform its duties hereunder. The vote or written consent of a majority of ARC members constitutes an act of the ARC under this Article. All approvals issued by the ARC must be in writing. Verbal approvals issued by the ARC or any individual committee member or any other representative of the Association are not valid, are not binding on the Association, and may not be relied on by any Person. The ARC shall keep and maintain a written record of all actions taken by it at such meetings. ARC members shall not receive any compensation for services rendered in serving on the ARC. 7.4. General Modifications Requiring Approval. No Alterations may be made by any Owner without the prior written approval of the Board. The ARC may require Owners to submit plans and specifications showing the nature, kind, shape, height, width, color, materials, and location of any proposed Alteration. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the provisions of this Article also apply to -31- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 the construction, installation, and alteration of solar energy systems, as defined in Section 801.5 of the Civil Code, and subject to the provisions of Section 714 and Section 4746 of the Civil Code, the City building code, and any other Applicable Laws. 7.5. Variances. The Board, but not the ARC, may, but is not required to, grant variances of adjustments, in its discretion if necessary to overcome practical difficulties due to topography or other conditions unique to a particular Unit, avoid unnecessary expense, or prevent unnecessary hardship in the application of the provisions of this Declaration; provided, however, that such variance or adjustment does not violate the purpose or purposes intended to be served by the standard or criteria being waived in such instance and is in conformity with the intent and purposes of this Declaration; and provided further, that no such variance shall constitute a waiver of such provision with respect to any future application whether for the same Unit or any other Unit. Any variance granted by the Board shall be noted in the written approval of the proposed work and may be required by the Board to be Recorded in the Official Records. 7.6. Architectural Changes Not Requiring Prior Approval. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to limit the right of an Owner to improve or alter the interior of his or her Unit; provided such interior Alteration does not impair or alter Common Area, any utilities, another Unit, or other structures and systems servicing Common Area or other Units in which case such interior Alterations will require ARC prior written approval. 7.7. Procedure for Obtaining Approval of Architectural Changes. In addition to the provisions set forth in this Section below, the procedure for obtaining the Board’s or ARC’s prior written approval for any Alteration shall also be as described in the Rules adopted by the Board regarding architectural approval. Unless changed by the Board or ARC, the address for the submission of plans and specifications is the Association’s management office. The architectural application form may include spaces allowing adjacent Owners to sign or initial the application confirming that they have been notified of the application. Applications are complete and may be approved or disapproved by the ARC even if all of the adjacent Owners do not sign or initial the application so long as the Owner submitting the plans and specifications certifies that he or she has asked the adjacent Owners to sign the application. If the ARC receives an application that the ARC determines is incomplete, then the ARC may reject the application for approval. The ARC shall transmit its recommendation and the reasons therefor to the submitting Owner at the address listed in the application for approval within thirty (80) days after the ARC receives a complete application and all required materials. If the ARC fails to transmit written approval, disapproval or a request for additional information or materials to the submitting Owner within thirty (30) days after the ARC receives a complete application and all required materials, then the submitting Owner may request a hearing before the Board. -32- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 If within six (6) months of the issuance of Board approval, an Owner does not either commence work pursuant to approved plans or obtain an extension of time to complete work, then such Board approval is automatically revoked, and the Owner must obtain a new Board approval before work can be commenced. 7.8. No Waiver of Future Approvals or Denials. The Board’s approval of proposals or plans and specifications or drawings for any work done or proposed or in connection with any other matter requiring approval by the Board or ARC does not waive any right to withhold approval of or deny similar proposals, plans and specifications, drawings or matters subsequently or additionally submitted for approval to the Board or ARC. 7.9. Architectural Rules. The Board may, in its sole discretion, adopt, amend, and repeal, as it deems necessary Rules that shall interpret and implement the provisions of this Article. The Board may also delegate this task to the ARC. The architectural Rules shall set forth the standards for review by the Board or ARC and guidelines for architectural design and the information that an Owner must present in connection with an architectural submittal. Unless an Owner complies with the architectural Rules, that Owner's plans and specifications shall be deemed incomplete and not submitted. 7.10. Standard of Architectural Review. The Board or ARC shall review an architectural submittal made by an Owner for conformity with the architectural Rules. The Board or ARC shall also consider additional factors including, but not limited to, the quality of proposed workmanship, the design and harmony of the Alteration with existing structures and aesthetic of the Project, the location of the proposed Alteration in relation to surrounding structures, topography, and finish grade elevation, Owner and contractor insurance coverage, compliance with governmental permit requirements, and contractor license status. 7.11. Application Fee and Security Deposit. The Board may establish a fee for the review and approval of plans and specifications that must be submitted pursuant to the provisions of this Article. Any such requirement and the amount of a fee shall be described in the architectural Rules. The Board may also require a security deposit to cover any potential damage to the Common Area that may result from the proposed work; however, an Owner’s liability for damage to the Common Area is not limited to any security deposit that may be required. 7.12. Compensation. Although Board and ARC members may not receive compensation for services rendered, other than reimbursement by the Association for expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties under this Article, the Board and ARC have the right, but not the duty, to hire an architect or other professional to consult with the Board or ARC. The Association may compensate the architect or other professional for consultation services rendered to the Board or ARC. -33- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 7.13. Liability. Neither the Board, the ARC, nor any member thereof, who has acted in good faith on the basis of such information as may be possessed by him or her, shall be liable to the Association or to any Owner, Resident, or Tenant for any damage, loss, or prejudice suffered or claimed on account of the approval or disapproval of any plans, drawings, or specifications, whether or not defective; the construction of any Alteration or performance of any work, whether or not pursuant to approved plans, drawings, or specifications; or the development of any property within the neighborhood. 7.14. Owner-Installed Improvements. 7.14.1. Effect of Owner-Installed Improvements. This Article applies to all Alterations installed on any Unit or Exclusive Use Common Area or elsewhere in the Project, either by a current or former Owner or by that Owner's Residents, Tenants, or anyone exercising the Owner's powers, and without regard to whether the Owner first complied with the requirements of this Article, including without limitation, the requirement for seeking and obtaining prior written approval before installing any such Improvements. 7.14.2. Owner Bears Costs. Each Owner shall pay all costs and expenses incurred in the construction and installation of any Alterations on his or her Unit or Exclusive Use Common Area and shall be fully responsible for their maintenance, repair, and replacement. Each Owner shall be responsible for any damages to persons, property, or otherwise that result from the construction, maintenance, use, or continued existence of such Alterations and shall hold Association free and harmless from any and all costs and expenses attributable to the construction, maintenance, use, or continued existence of such Alterations or to their continued existence or use. The Association shall have no responsibility either for securing or maintaining insurance for any such Alterations. 7.14.3. Owner Responsibility for Compliance. Each Owner covenants and agrees that he or she will obtain prior written approval of the Board or ARC for any Alteration. Each Owner further covenants and agrees that any Alteration shall be constructed in strict compliance with the plans and specifications and in the exact location approved by the Board or ARC; shall be maintained in good condition and repair in accordance with generally accepted construction and maintenance practices; and shall comply with Applicable Law. Owner shall be obligated to obtain any necessary building permits and inspections and to verify compliance with all requirements imposed by law. Association's approval of any such Alterations, if given, is limited to an approval based solely on the criteria contained in the Governing Documents and does not include a review for compliance with Applicable Laws. 7.14.4. Alterations Subject to Association Jurisdiction. All Alterations shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Association, acting through the Board or ARC, and to the Governing Documents; and shall be subject to an easement in favor of the Association to perform Its duties under the Governing Documents. As -34- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 such, each Owner shall pay all costs and expenses incurred in removing and replacing the Alteration, if such removal is required by the Association, in its sole discretion, to perform its maintenance responsibilities under the Governing Documents. The Association shall exercise such discretion reasonably and not arbitrarily. 7.14.5. Alterations for Disabilities. With the prior written approval of the Board or ARC, an Owner may modify the Owner’s Unit and the route over the Common Area leading to the front door of such Owner's Unit, at such Owner’s sole expense, to facilitate access to the Owner’s Unit by persons who are blind, visually impaired, deaf, or physically disabled, or to alter conditions that could be hazardous to such persons in accordance with Section 4760(a)(2) of the Civil Code or any other Applicable Law. 7.15. Indemnification. Each Owner shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Association, its Members, Board members, ARC or other committee members, officers, agents, and employees from and against any and all injuries, damages, causes of action, or claims that may exist or be instituted against any or all of said parties because of, or in any manner arising from or connected with, the granting of written confirmation of approval for any Alteration, the power to grant and confirm such approval in writing, or the construction, maintenance, use, or continued existence of such Alterations. Each Owner releases the Association, its Members, Board members, ARC or other committee members, officers, agents, and employees from any duty or obligation to pay, or otherwise be responsible, for the cost of construction, maintenance, use, or continued existence of any such Alterations, and releases said parties from any and all claims, injuries, damages, and causes of action that may arise as a result of the construction, maintenance, use, or continued existence of the Alterations. 7.16. No Waiver of Future Approvals. The ARC’s approval of proposals or plans and specifications or drawings for any work done or proposed or in connection with any other matter requiring the ARC’s approval does not waive any right to withhold approval of similar proposals, plans and specifications, drawings or matters subsequently or additionally submitted for approval. 7.17. Inspection of Work. The Board or ARC or its duly authorized representative may inspect any Alterations for which approval of plans is required under this Article. The right to inspect includes the right to require any Owner to take such action as may be necessary to remedy any noncompliance with the Board- or ARC-approved plans for the Alteration or with the requirements of this Declaration. 7.17.1. Time Limit. The Board or ARC’s right to inspect the Alteration and notify the responsible Owner of any noncompliance shall terminate sixty (60) days after the work is completed and the Board or ARC receives from such Owner written notice on a form provided by the Board or ARC that the work for the Alteration is completed. If the Board or ARC fails to send a -35- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 notice of noncompliance to an Owner before this time limit expires, then the Alteration shall be deemed to comply with the approved plans. 7.17.2. Remedy. If an Owner fails to remedy any noncompliance within sixty (60) days after the date of notice of noncompliance from the ARC, then the ARC shall notify the Board in writing of such failure unless no ARC exists in which case notice to the Board shall be deemed complete upon the expiration of the date the Board sent the Owner a notice of noncompliance. After Notice and Hearing, the Board shall determine whether there is a noncompliance and, if so, the nature thereof and the estimated cost of correcting or removing the noncompliance. If a noncompliance exists, then the Owner shall remedy or remove the noncompliance within a period of not more than forty-five (45) days after the date that notice of the Board ruling is given to the Owner. If the Owner does not comply with the Board ruling within that period of time, then the Association may correct the noncompliance and charge such Owner for the Association’s costs, levy a Reimbursement Assessment, and/or commence an action for damages or injunctive relief, as appropriate, to remedy the noncompliance. 7.17.3. Remedy for Failure to Complete Work. If an Owner fails to complete work pursuant to the approved plans within one (1) year from the date the approval for the Alteration is issued, then a noncompliance is deemed to exist, and the Association can pursue the remedies listed in Section 7.16.2. 7.18. Certificate of Completion. Upon the request of an Owner, or pursuant to procedures established in the architectural Rules, after the Board or ARC determines that the Alteration has been completed in accordance with Board- or ARC-approved plans, the Board or ARC shall execute and deliver to such Owner a certificate confirming that the work for the Alteration was completed in accordance with approved plans. 7.19. Pre-Approvals. The Board or ARC may, but need not necessarily, authorize pre-approval of certain specified types of construction activities if, in the exercise of the Board’s or ARC’s judgment, pre-approval of such types of Alterations is appropriate in carrying out the purposes of the Governing Documents. 7.20. Appeals. If the ARC disapproves a complete architectural application, the submitting Owner may appeal such decision to the Board within thirty (30) days of disapproval by the ARC. If the ARC approves a complete architectural application but a neighboring Owner objects, the objecting Owner may appeal such decision to the Board within thirty (30) days of approval by the ARC. The Board shall review the application and either approve or disapprove the application by a majority vote of the Board. The decision of the Board in its sole and absolute discretion, shall be final. -36- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 ARTICLE VIII - INSURANCE 8.1. Association Duty to Obtain Insurance; Types. The Association shall obtain, and keep in effect at all times, the following insurance coverages: 8.1.1. Fire and Casualty Insurance. An all-risk blanket policy or policies of casualty and fire insurance, with an extended coverage endorsement in an amount equal to as near as possible one hundred percent (100%) of the full insurable replacement cost without deduction for depreciation of the Common Area together with all Improvements located therein and personal property owned by the Association or all Owners in common. 8.1.2. General Liability Insurance. Adequate commercial general liability insurance, with limits approved by the Board but in no event less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) or any other applicable limit as set forth in Civil Code section 5805, insuring against liability for bodily injury, death, and property damage arising from the activities of the Association and the Residents with respect to the Common Area. 8.1.3. Earthquake Insurance. The Association may carry earthquake insurance with such coverage and deductibles as the Board may from time to time determine. 8.1.4. Directors and Officers Insurance. Directors and officers liability insurance with limits to be set by the Board but in no event less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or any higher applicable limit set forth in Civil Code section 5800, and containing a cross-liability endorsement and waiver of subrogation as to the Association, its, directors and officers, and its agents and employees, including coverage for prior acts to the extent obtainable. 8.1.5. Fidelity Insurance. In accordance with section 5806 of the Civil Code, unless the Governing Documents require greater coverage amounts, the Association shall maintain crime insurance, employee dishonesty coverage, fidelity bond coverage, or their equivalent, for its directors, officers, and employees (if any) in an amount that is equal to or more than the combined amount of the Association’s reserves and total Assessments for three months. The coverage maintained by the Association shall also include protection in an equal amount against computer fraud and funds transferred fraud. If the Association uses a managing agent or management company, the Association’s crime insurance, employee dishonesty coverage, fidelity bond coverage, or their equivalent, shall additionally include coverage for, or otherwise be endorsed to provide coverage for, dishonest acts by that person or entity and its employees. Self-insurance does not meet the requirements of this Section. -37- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 8.1.6. Insurance Required by Mortgagees. The Association’s insurance coverage shall meet the applicable insurance requirements for condominium projects established by Mortgagees, except to the extent that such coverage is not reasonably available or is available but at a cost that the Board in its sole discretion determines is unreasonable under the circumstances. 8.1.7. Other Insurance. Such other insurance as the Board may from time to time deem necessary or desirable insuring for risks customarily insured by associations managing condominium projects similar to the Project in construction, location, and use, including without limitation workers compensation insurance. 8.1.8. Beneficiaries. The Association’s insurance shall be kept for the benefit of the Association, the Owners, and the Mortgagees, as their interests may appear, as named insureds, subject, however, to loss payment requirements established in this Declaration. 8.2. Waiver of Claim Against Association. As to all policies of insurance kept by or for the benefit of the Association and the Owners, the Association and the Owners waive and release all claims against one another and the Board, to the extent of the insurance proceeds available, whether or not the insurable damage or injury is caused by the negligence of or breach of any agreement by any of such Persons. 8.3. Right and Duty of Owners to Insure. Each Owner is responsible, at his or her sole expense, to maintain an “HO6 Condominium Owner's Policy” or equivalent insuring such Owner's individual liability for damage to property or injury to person occurring within an Owner’s Unit, insuring property damage to contents and personal property within an Owner's Unit, and insuring all other property and improvements in such Owner’s Unit in an amount sufficient to restore the improvements in the Unit to a condition at least equivalent to the standard as existed prior to any casualty. Nothing in this Declaration precludes any Owner from carrying any other insurance as such Owner considers desirable; however, Owners’ insurance policies may not adversely affect or diminish any coverage under any of the Association’s insurance policies. Duplicate copies of Owners’ insurance policies shall be deposited with the Association upon request. If any loss intended to be covered by the Association’s insurance occurs and the proceeds payable are reduced due to insurance carried by any Owner, then such Owner shall assign the proceeds of such Owner’s insurance to the Association, to the extent of such reduction, for application to the same purposes as the reduced proceeds are to be applied. Any Owner insurance policy shall contain a waiver of subrogation as to any claims against the Association, its directors, officers, managers, and Owners and a waiver of all defenses based on acts of the insureds or the existence of coinsurance. -38- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 8.4. Notice of Expiration Requirements. If available, each of the Association’s insurance policies must contain a provision that the policy may not be canceled, terminated, materially modified, or allowed to expire by its terms, without at least ten (10) days’ prior written notice to the Board and to each Owner and Mortgagee, insurer, and guarantor of a first Mortgage who has filed a written request with the carrier for such notice and every other Person in interest who requests such notice of the insurer. In addition, fidelity insurance shall provide that it may not be canceled or substantially modified without at least ten (10) days’ prior written notice to any insurance trustee named pursuant to Section 8.6 and to each Mortgage servicer who has filed a written request with the carrier for such notice. 8.5. Insurance Premiums. Premiums for insurance policies obtained by the Association are Common Expenses. 8.6. Trustee for Policies. The Association is trustee of the interests of all named insureds under the Association’s insurance policies. Unless an insurance policy provides for a different procedure for the filing of claims, all claims made under such policy must be sent to the insurance carrier or agent by certified mail or overnight delivery with proof of same and be clearly identified as a claim. The Association shall keep a record of all claims made. All insurance proceeds under any of such insurance policies provided for in Section 8.1 must be paid to the Board as trustees. The Board has the authority to negotiate loss settlements with insurance carriers, with participation, to the extent they desire, of first Mortgagees who have filed written requests within ten (10) days of receipt of notice of any damage or destruction as provided in Section 8.4. Any two (2) officers of the Association may sign a loss claim form and release form in connection with the settlement of a loss claim, and such signatures are binding on all the named insureds. A representative chosen by the Board may be named as an insured, including a trustee with whom the Association may enter into an insurance trust agreement and any successor to such trustee, who shall have exclusive authority to negotiate losses under any insurance policy and to perform such other functions necessary to accomplish this purpose. 8.7. Actions as Trustee. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Declaration, the Board has the exclusive right to bind the Association and the Owners with respect to all matters affecting insurance carried by the Association, the settlement of a loss claim, and the surrender, cancellation, and modification of all such insurance. Duplicate originals or certificates of all policies of fire and casualty insurance kept by the Association and of all renewals thereof, together with proof of payment of premiums, shall be delivered by the Association to all Owners and Mortgagees who requested them in writing. 8.8. Annual Insurance Review. The Board shall review the Association’s insurance policies at least annually to determine the amount of the casualty and fire insurance coverage referred to in Section 8.1. Before each such annual review, if economically feasible, the Board shall obtain -39- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 from a qualified independent insurance appraiser a current appraisal of the full replacement value of the Improvements in the Project, without deduction for depreciation. In the Board’s discretion, such insurance may exclude coverage for footings and foundations. 8.9. Required Waiver. All of the Association’s insurance policies insuring against physical damage must provide, if reasonably possible, for waiver of: (a) | Subrogation of claims against the Owners and their Family members and Tenants; (b) Any defense based on coinsurance; (c) Any right of setoff, counterclaim, apportionment, proration, or contribution due to other insurance not carried by the Association; (d) Any invalidity, other adverse effect, or defense due to any breach of warranty or condition caused by the Association, any Owner or his or her Family member or Tenant, or arising from any act or omission of any named insured or the respective agents, contractors, and employees of any insured; (e) — Any right of the insurer to repair, rebuild or replace and, if the Improvement is not repaired, rebuilt, or replaced following loss, any right to pay under the insurance an amount less than the replacement value of the Improvements insured; (f) Notice of the assignment of any Owner of such Owner's interest in the insurance by virtue of a conveyance of any Condominium; (g) Any right to require any assignment of any Mortgage to the insurer; (h) — Any denial of an Owner's claim because of negligent acts by the Association or other Owners; and (i) Prejudice of the insurance by acts or omissions of Owners that are not under the Association’s control. 8.10. Responsibility for Payment of Deductible. In the event of damage to the Common Area (including Exclusive Use Common Area) that is covered by the Association’s fire and casualty insurance policy pursuant to Section 8.1.1, the deductible shall be paid by the Association. In the event of damage to a Unit that is covered by the Owner’s casualty insurance policy pursuant to Section 8.3, the deductible shall be paid by the Owner of the damaged Unit. Nothing in this Section shall prevent any Person from recovering the amount of any deductible paid by such Person for any other Person responsible for the loss under tort or other theories of liability. -40- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 ARTICLE IX —- DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION. 9.1. Restoration of the Project. Except as otherwise authorized by the Owners, if any portion of the Project that the Association is responsible for maintaining is destroyed, then the Association shall restore such destroyed portion of the Project to its former condition as promptly as practical. The Association shall use the proceeds of its insurance for reconstruction or repair of the Project unless otherwise authorized in this Declaration. The Board shall prepare or obtain the documents necessary for commencing such reconstruction as promptly as practical. The Project shall be reconstructed or rebuilt substantially in accordance with the Condominium Plan and the original construction plans if they are available, unless changes recommended by the Architectural Review Committee have been approved by at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the Owners. If the insurance proceeds amount to at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the estimated cost of restoration and repair, then the Board shall levy a Special Assessment to provide the additional funds necessary for such reconstruction. If the insurance proceeds amount to less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the estimated cost of restoration and repair, then the Board may levy a Special Assessment and proceed with the restoration and repair only if both of the following conditions have been satisfied: (a) the levy of a Special Assessment to pay the costs of restoration and repair of the Project is approved by the requisite vote of the Owners; and (b) within one (1) year after the date on which the destruction occurred, the Board Records a certificate of the resolution authorizing the restoration and repair. If either of the preceding conditions to reconstruction do not occur following a destruction for which insurance proceeds available for restoration and repair are less than eighty -five percent (85%) of the estimated cost of restoration and repair, then the Board shall proceed as provided in Section 9.2. 9.2. Sale of Project and Right to Partition. No Owner shall have the right to partition such Owner's interest in the Condominium, and there shall be no judicial partition of the Project, or any part thereof, except as provided in Section 4610 of the Civil Code. For purposes of Subsection 4 of Section 4610, partition may occur only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (a) either or both of the conditions to reconstruction described in Section 9.1 have failed to occur; (b) within six (6) months after the date on which destruction occurred, restoration or repair has not actually commenced; and (c) the Owners of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the Condominiums in the Project approve the partition. In such event, the Association shall prepare, execute and Record, as promptly as practical, the certificate stating that a majority of the Board may properly exercise an irrevocable power of attorney to sell the Project for the benefit of the Owners and execute such other documents and instruments as may be necessary for the Association to consummate the sale of the Project at the highest and best price obtainable, either in its damaged condition or after damaged structures have been razed. Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of such authority for any Person relying thereon in good faith. The net proceeds of such sale and the proceeds of any insurance carried by the Association shall be divided proportionately among the Owners, such proportions to be determined in accordance with the relative appraised fair market valuation of the Condominiums as of a date -41- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 immediately before such destruction (or condemnation), expressed as percentages, and computed by dividing such appraised valuation of each Condominium by the total of such appraised valuations of all Condominiums in the Project. The Board is authorized to hire one (1) or more appraisers for such a purpose, and the cost of such appraisals shall be a Common Expense. However, the balance then due on any valid Mortgage shall be paid first in order of priority before the distribution of proceeds to an Owner whose Condominium is so encumbered. Nothing in this Declaration prevents the partition of a co-tenancy in any Condominium.

The Board, immediately upon having knowledge of any damage or destruction affecting a Unit or a material portion of the Common Area, shall promptly notify all Owners and Mortgagees, including insurers and guarantors, of first Mortgages on Condominiums in the Project who have filed a written request for such notice with the Board. ARTICLE X — EMINENT DOMAIN 10.1. Taking Defined. The term “taking” as used in this Article means condemnation by exercise of the power of eminent domain or by sale under threat of the exercise of the power of eminent domain by a governmental or quasi-governmental entity. The Board shall represent the Owners in all proceedings, negotiations, settlements, or agreements regarding takings. All takings proceeds shall be payable to the Association for the benefit of the Owners and their Mortgagees and shall be distributed to such Owners and Mortgagees as provided in this Article. 10.2. Property Condemnation. If there is a taking of an interest in all or part of the Project such that the ownership, operation, and use of the Project in accordance with this Declaration is substantially and adversely affected, and within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of -42- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 such taking the Owners of Units not taken or only partially taken but capable of being restored to at least ninety-five percent (95%) of their floor area and substantially to their condition before such taking (collectively, the “Remaining Units”) do not by affirmative vote of at least one-third (1/3) of their voting power approve the continuation of the Project and the repair, restoration and replacement to the extent feasible of the Common Area and the Remaining Units, then the Board shall proceed with the sale of that portion of the Project that was not taken and distribute the net proceeds of such sale after deducting all incidental fees and expenses, in the same proportion and manner as provided in Section 9.2. 10.3. Condemnation of Common Area. If there is a taking of a portion of the Common Area or any interest therein (other than the taking of an undivided interest therein taken as a result of the taking of a Condominium), then the award in condemnation shall be paid to the Association and shall be deposited in the Operating Fund. 10.4. Condemnation of Condominiums. If there is a taking of a Condominium, then the award in condemnation shall be paid to the Owner of such Condominium; however, such award shall be applied first to the balance then due on Mortgages encumbering such Owner’s Condominium, in order of priority. 10.5. Condemnation of Portions of Units. 10.5.1. Minor Takings Within Limits. If (a) there is a taking of a portion of one (1) or more Units that does not substantially and adversely affect the Units’ ability to serve as residences, and (b) restoration of such Units can be accomplished at a cost less than or equal to the sum of (i) the amount of the condemnation award for such takings plus (ii) all amounts that the Owners of the taken Units desire to contribute to restoration plus (iii) an amount less than or equal to five percent (5%) of the budgeted gross expenses of the Association for such Fiscal Year (collectively, the “Allowable Cost”), then the Board shall contract for such restoration and levy a Special Assessment in an amount equal to the Allowable Cost minus the amount of the condemnation awards and Owners’ contributions, and the condemnation awards, Owners’ contributions and Special Assessment shall be applied to such restoration. If the restoration is accomplished at a cost less than the amount of the condemnation awards, then that portion of the condemnation awards that exceeds the restoration costs shall be paid to the Owners of the partially taken Units in proportion to the decrease in the fair market value of their Condominiums; however, such awards shall be applied first to the balance then due on Mortgages encumbering such Owners’ Condominiums, in order of priority. 10.5.2. Minor Takings Exceeding Limits. If (a) there is a taking of a portion of one (1) or more Units that does not substantially and adversely affect the Units’ ability to serve as residences, and (b) restoration cannot be accomplished at a cost less than or equal to the Allowable Cost, then the Board shall -43- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 hold a special election of the Owners. If more than fifty percent (50%) of the Total Voting Power of the Association casts a valid ballot, and a majority of the votes cast in such special election are in favor of levying a Special Assessment in an amount equal to the restoration costs minus the sum of the amount of the condemnation awards and the amounts the Owners of the taken Units desire to contribute to such restoration, then the Board shall contract for such restoration and levy a Special Assessment, and the condemnation awards, Owners’ contributions and Special Assessment shall be applied to such restoration. 10.5.3. Major Takings. If neither Section 10.5.1 nor 10.5.2 applies to a taking of a Unit or Units, then the award in condemnation shall be paid to the Owners of the taken Units; however, such award shall be applied first to the balance then due on Mortgages encumbering such Owners’ Condominiums, in order of priority. The Board shall have the remaining portions of the taken Units razed and it shall become part of the Common Area, and the Owners of such taken Units, by acceptance of the award allotted to them in the taking proceedings, relinquish (a) to the other Owners, on the basis of their relative ownership of the Common Area therein, such Owners’ undivided interest in the Common Area, and (b) to the Association, the remaining portions of the Units. Each Owner relinquishing such Owner's interest in the Common Area pursuant to this Section shall, at the Board’s request and at the Association’s expense, execute and acknowledge such deeds and other instruments that the Board considers necessary or convenient to evidence such relinquishment. Each Owner of a taken Unit is not liable for Assessments under this Declaration that accrue on or after the date on which such Owner accepts such Owner’s condemnation award. 10.6. Portions of Awards in Condemnation not Compensatory for Value of Real Property. Those portions of awards in condemnation that do not directly compensate Owners for takings of real property (e.g., awards for takings of personal property, relocation expenses, moving expenses or other allowances of a similar nature intended to facilitate relocation) shall be paid to the Owners whose personal property is taken or whose relocation is intended to be facilitated. 10.7. Notice to Owners and Mortgagees. The Board, upon learning of any condemnation proceeding affecting a Unit or a material portion of the Project, or any threat thereof, shall promptly notify all Owners and those Mortgagees, insurers and guarantors of Mortgages on Condominiums in the Project who have filed a written request for such notice with the Association.

Cure of Preexisting Violations.

Effect of Amendments. No amendment to this Declaration shall affect the rights of Mortgagees under any Mortgage made in good faith and for value and Recorded prior to the recordation of such amendment unless the Mortgagee either joins in the execution of the amendment or approves of it in writing as part of such amendment. 11.12. Actions Requiring Mortgagees’ Consent. Except as provided by statute in the case of condemnation or substantial loss to the Units and/or Common Area, unless at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the first Mortgagees (based on one (1) vote for each first Mortgage owned) have given their prior written approval, the Association may not: (a) by act or omission seek to abandon or terminate the Project; (b) | change the pro rata interest or obligations of any Condominium (i) to levy Assessments or charges, or allocate distributions of hazard insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, or (ii) for determining the pro rata share of ownership of each Condominium in the Common Area; (c) partition or subdivide any Condominium; (d) by act or omission, seek to abandon, partition, subdivide, encumber, sell, or transfer the Common Area.

Mortgage Protection. No breach of any of the covenants, conditions, and restrictions nor the enforcement of any lien provisions contained in this Declaration shall render invalid the lien of any first Mortgage made in good faith and for value on any Condominium, but all of the covenants, conditions, and restrictions shall be binding upon and effective against any Owner whose title is derived through foreclosure, trustee’s sale or otherwise. ARTICLE XiIl- ENFORCEMENT 12.1. Enforcement of the Governing Documents. All disputes arising under the Governing Documents and alleged violations of the Governing Documents shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures established in this Declaration, any Rules adopted by the Board, and Applicable Law. 12.1.1. Owner’s Responsibility for Conduct and Damages. Each Owner shall be fully responsible for informing members of his or her household, Tenants, invitees, and Guests of the provisions of the Governing Documents, and shall be fully responsible for the conduct, activities, and any Governing Document violations by any of them, and for any damage to the Project or the Association resulting from the negligent or intentional conduct of any of them or the conduct of any pet belonging to any of them. If a Condominium is owned jointly by two (2) or more Persons, the liability of each Owner in connection with the obligations imposed by the Governing Documents shall be joint and several; that is, each co-Owner individually shall be fully liable and responsible and all co-Owners collectively shall be fully liable and responsible. 12.1.2. Violations as Nuisance. Every act or omission constituting or resulting in a violation of any of the provisions of the Governing Documents shall be deemed to constitute a nuisance and, in addition to any other remedies which may be available, such nuisance may be abated or enjoined by the Association or its officers or Board of Directors or by any Owner; provided, however, that the Board shall not be obligated to take action to abate or enjoin a particular violation if, in the exercise of its discretion, the Board determines that acting to abate or enjoin such violation is not likely to foster or protect the interests of the Association and its Members as a whole. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and -47- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 without limiting the generality of the conditions therein, nothing in the Governing Documents shall be deemed to impose upon the Association, the Board, or the officers, employees, or agents of the Association a duty to intervene in any physical dispute or altercation or any criminal or alleged criminal activity other than to notify law enforcement officials. 12.1.3. Violations of Law. Any violation of a state, municipal, or local law, ordinance or regulation pertaining to the ownership, occupancy, or use of any property within the Project is hereby declared to be a violation of this Declaration and subject to any and all of the enforcement procedures set forth herein. 12.1.4. Violations Identified by the Association. If the violation involves nonpayment of any Assessment, then the Board may collect the delinquent Assessment pursuant to the procedures established in Section 12.2 and Section 12.3. For all other alleged violations brought to the attention of the Board, the Board shall follow the violation investigation and correction procedure established in this Article as well as any Rules adopted by the Board including Notice and Hearing, internal dispute resolution as described in Civil Code section 5915, and alternative dispute resolution as described in Civil Code section 5925, and, if the violation is not resolved, then proceed as described in Section 12.1.5. 12.1.5. Legal Proceedings. Failure to comply with any of the terms of the Governing Documents by any Owner or his or her Family members, Tenants, or Guests may result in legal action against the Owner for monetary damages, injunctive relief, foreclosure of any lien, or any combination thereof. 12.1.6. No Waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Declaration does not waive the right to enforce such provision or any other provision of this Declaration. 12.1.7. Right to Enforce. The Board and any Owner may enforce the Governing Documents as described in this Article, subject to Applicable Law. Each Owner has a right of action against the Association for the Association’s failure to comply with the Governing Documents. Each remedy provided for in this Declaration is cumulative and not exclusive or exhaustive. 12.2. Nonpayment of Assessments. 12.2.1. Delinquency. Assessments are delinquent if not paid within fifteen (15) days after the due date established by the Association. The Association may require the delinquent Owner to pay a late charge in accordance with Section 5650(b)(2) of the Civil Code. Assessments not paid within thirty (30) days after the due date, plus all reasonable fees and costs of collection (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and late charges, bear interest at the -48- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 maximum rate permitted by law commencing thirty (30) days after the due date until paid. All Assessments, late charges, reasonable fees and costs of collection, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and interest shall be a debt of the Owner at the time the Assessments or other sums are levied. Payments made by an Owner shall be applied first to the Assessments owed and, only after the Assessments owed are paid in full, shall be applied to accumulated fees and costs of collection, attorneys’ fees, late charges, or interest. The Association shall provide a mailing address for overnight payment of Assessments. 12.2.2. Creation and Release of Lien. (a) Priority of Lien. All liens levied in accordance with this Declaration shall be prior and superior to (i) any declaration of homestead Recorded after the recordation of this Declaration and (ii) all other liens, except (A) all taxes, bonds, assessments and other levies that, by law, would be superior thereto and (B) the lien or charge of any first Mortgage of Record (meaning any Recorded Mortgage with first priority or seniority over other Mortgages) made in good faith and for value and Recorded before the date on which the Notice of Delinquent Assessment (as defined in this Section) against the assessed Condominium was Recorded. (b) Prerequisites to Creating Lien. Before the Association may place a lien on an Owner's Condominium to collect a past due Assessment or other debt that is past due, the Association shall do all of the following: (i) At least thirty (30) days before Recording a lien for delinquent Assessments, the Association shall send by certified mail to the delinquent Owner a written notice (“Notice of Intent to Lien”) that contains all of the information required by Civil Code Section 5660. (ii) | The Association shall offer such Owner and, if so requested by such Owner, shall participate in internal dispute resolution to the extent required pursuant to Civil Code section 5673. (c) Owner’s Right to Request Meeting; Payment Plans. An Owner may submit a written request to meet with the Board to discuss a payment plan for the debt set forth in the Notice of Intent to Lien and the Association shall provide the requesting Owner with any standards for payment plans. The Board shall meet with such Owner in executive session within forty-five (45) days of the postmark of such Owner's written request if such request is mailed within fifteen (15) days of the date of the postmark of the Notice of Intent to Lien, unless there is no regularly-scheduled Board meeting within such period, in which case the Board may designate a committee of one (1) or more members to meet with such Owner. A payment plan may incorporate any and all Assessments that accrue during the payment plan period. A payment plan shall not impede the Association’s ability to Record a lien on an Owner's Condominium to secure payment of delinquent Assessments. Additional late fees shall not accrue during the payment plan period if the Owner is in compliance with the terms of the payment plan. In -49- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 the event of a default on any payment plan, the Association may resume its efforts to collect the delinquent Assessments from the time before entering into the payment plan. (d) Notice of Delinquent Assessment. The lien becomes effective upon recordation of a Notice of Delinquent Assessment (“Notice of Delinquent Assessment”) securing the payment of any Assessment or installment thereof levied by the Association against any Owner, as provided in Civil Code section 5675. An itemized statement shall be Recorded together with the Notice of Delinquent Assessment. The Notice of Delinquent Assessment must identify (i) the amount of the Assessment and other authorized charges and interest, including the cost of preparing and Recording the Notice of Delinquent Assessment, (ii) the amount of collection costs incurred, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, (iii) a sufficient description of the Condominium that has been assessed, (iv) the Association’s name and address, (v) the name of the Owner of the Condominium that has been assessed and (vi) if the lien is to be enforced by nonjudicial foreclosure, the name and address of the trustee authorized by the Association to enforce the lien by sale. The Notice of Delinquent Assessment must be signed by an authorized Association officer or agent. A copy of the Recorded Notice of Delinquent Assessment shall be mailed by certified mail to every Person whose name is shown as an Owner of the Condominium in the Association’s records no later than ten (10) calendar days after Recordation. The lien relates only to the individual Condominium against which the Assessment was levied and not to the Project as a whole. (e) Decision to Record Lien. The decision to Record a lien for delinquent Assessments shall be made only by the Board and may not be delegated to an agent of the Association. The Board shall approve the decision by a majority vote of the Directors in an open meeting of the Board. The Board shall record the vote in the minutes of that meeting. (f) Exceptions. Pursuant to Civil Code Section 5725\\(b), Enforcement Assessments may not become a lien against an Owner's Condominium enforceable by trustee’s sale of such Condominium under Sections 2924, 2924b and 2924c of the Civil Code. (g) Release of Lien. Upon payment of the full amount claimed in the Notice of Delinquent Assessment or other satisfaction thereof, the Board shall cause to be Recorded a Notice of Satisfaction and Release of Lien (the “Notice of Release”) stating the satisfaction and release of the amount claimed. The Board may require the Owner to pay a reasonable charge for preparing and Recording the Notice of Release. Any purchaser or encumbrancer who has acted in good faith and extended value may rely on the Notice of Release as conclusive evidence of the full satisfaction of the sums identified as owed in the Notice of Delinquent Assessment. 12.2.3. Enforcement of Liens. The Board shall enforce the collection of amounts due under this Declaration by one (1) or more of the alternative means of relief afforded by this Declaration. The lien on a Condominium may be enforced by foreclosure and sale of the Condominium after failure of the Owner to pay any Assessment, or installment thereof, as provided in this -50- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 Declaration. The sale shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code applicable to the exercise of powers of sale in Mortgages or in any manner permitted by law, including sale by the court, sale by the trustee designated in the Notice of Delinquent Assessment or sale by a trustee substituted pursuant to Section 2934a of the Civil Code. Any sale by the trustee shall be conducted in accordance with Sections 2924, 2924b and 2924c of the Civil Code applicable to the exercise of powers of sale in mortgages and deeds of trusts, and the fees of a trustee may not exceed the amounts prescribed in Sections 2924c and 2924d of the Civil Code. In addition to the requirements of Section 2924 of the Civil Code, the Association shall serve a Notice of Delinquent Assessment on the Owner’s legal representative in accordance with the manner of service of summons in Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10) of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The Owner’s legal representative shall be the Person whose name is shown as the Owner of such Owner’s Condominium in the Association’s records, unless another Person has been previously designated by such Owner as such Owner's legal representative in writing and mailed to the Association in a manner that indicates that the Association has received it. Subject to the provisions of Section 12.3, the Association may sue to foreclose the lien if (i) at least thirty (80) days have elapsed since the date on which the Notice of Delinquent Assessment was Recorded and (ii) at least ten (10) days have elapsed since a copy of the Notice of Delinquent Assessment was mailed by certified mail to every Person whose name is shown in the Association’s records as an Owner of the Condominium affected thereby. The Association may bid on the Condominium at foreclosure sale and acquire and hold, lease, mortgage and convey the Condominium. Upon completion of the foreclosure sale, the Association or the purchaser at the sale may file suit to secure occupancy of the defaulting Owner’s Condominium, and the defaulting Owner shall be required to pay the reasonable rental value for the Condominium during any period of continued occupancy by the defaulting Owner or any Person claiming under the defaulting Owner. A suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid Assessments may be brought without foreclosing or waiving any lien securing the obligation to pay such Assessments, but this provision or any suit to recover a money judgment does not affirm the adequacy of money damages. Any recovery resulting from a suit at law or in equity initiated pursuant to this Section may include reasonable attorneys’ fees as fixed by the court. 12.2.4. Priority of Assessment Lien. Mortgages Recorded before a Notice of Delinquent Assessment have lien priority over the Notice of Delinquent Assessment. The sale or transfer of any Condominium does not affect the Assessment lien, except that the sale or transfer of any Condominium pursuant to judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of a first Mortgage extinguishes the lien of such Assessment as to payments that became due before such sale or transfer. No sale or transfer relieves such Condominium from liens for any Assessment thereafter becoming due. No Person who obtains title to a Condominium pursuant to a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of the first Mortgage is liable for the share of the Common Expenses or Assessments chargeable to such Condominium that became due before the acquisition of title to the Condominium by such Person. Such unpaid share of Common Expenses or Assessments is a Common Expense collectible from all Owners, including such Person. -51- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 The Association may take such action as is necessary to make any Assessment lien subordinate to the interests of the Department of Veterans Affairs of the State of California under its Cal-Vet loan contracts as if the Cal-Vet loan contracts were first Mortgages of Record. 12.2.5. Alternative Dispute Resolution. Before initiating a foreclosure for any delinquent Assessment, the Association shall offer the Owner and, if so requested by the Owner, shall participate in internal dispute resolution or alternative dispute resolution with a neutral third party pursuant to Section 5660 of the Civil Code. The decision to pursue dispute resolution shall be the choice of the Owner, except that binding arbitration shall not be available if the Association intends to initiate a judicial foreclosure. 12.2.6. Secondary Addresses of Owners. Upon receipt of a written request by an Owner identifying a secondary address for purposes of collection notices, the Association shall send additional copies of any and all notices required by this Section 12.2 to the secondary address provided. The Association shall notify Owners of their right to submit secondary addresses to the Association, at the time the Association issues the annual Budget. Each Owner’s request shall be in writing and shall be mailed to the Association in a manner that shall indicate the Association has received it. Any Owner may identify or change a secondary address at any time; provided that, if a secondary address is identified or changed during the collection process, the Association shall only be required to send notices to the indicated secondary address from the point the Association receives the request. 12.2.7. Receivers. In addition to the foreclosure and other remedies granted to the Association in this Declaration, each Owner, by acceptance of a deed to such Owner’s Condominium, conveys to the Association all of such Owner's right, title and interest in all rents, issues and profits derived from and appurtenant to such Condominium, subject to the right of the Association to collect and apply such rents, issues and profits to delinquent Assessments owed by such Owner, reserving to such Owner the right, before any default by such Owner in the payment of Assessments, to collect and retain such rents, issues and profits as they may become due and payable. Upon any such default, the Association may, upon the expiration of thirty (80) days following delivery to the Owner of the Notice of Delinquent Assessment described in this Declaration, either in person, by agent or by receiver to be appointed by a court, and without regard to the adequacy of any security for the indebtedness secured by the lien described in this Declaration, (a) enter in or on and take possession of the Condominium or any part thereof, (b) in the Association’s name, sue for or otherwise collect such rents, issues and profits, including those past due and unpaid, and (c) apply the same, less allowable expenses of operation, to any delinquency of such Owner and in such order as the Association may determine. The entering upon and taking possession of the Condominium, the collection of rents, issues and profits and the application thereof shall not cure or waive any default or notice of default under this Declaration or invalidate any act done pursuant to such notice. -52- Amended and Restated CC&Rs (Final) -dpb 04152025 12.3. Collection of Delinquent Assessments Through Foreclosure. The Association is authorized to collect delinquent Assessments through an action at law or by judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure or by any other means authorized by Applicable Law.

Each Owner shall pay Annual Assessments in installments at such frequency and in such amounts and by such methods as are established by the Board.

Any recovery resulting from a suit at law or in equity initiated pursuant to this Section may include reasonable attorneys’ fees as fixed by the court. 12.2.4. Priority of Assessment Lien. Mortgages Recorded before a Notice of Delinquent Assessment have lien priority over the Notice of Delinquent Assessment. The sale or transfer of any Condominium does not affect the Assessment lien, except that the sale or transfer of any Condominium pursuant to judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of a first Mortgage extinguishes the lien of such Assessment as to payments that became due before such sale or transfer.

Secondary Addresses of Owners. Upon receipt of a written request by an Owner identifying a secondary address for purposes of collection notices, the Association shall send additional copies of any and all notices required by this Section 12.2 to the secondary address provided. The Association shall notify Owners of their right to submit secondary addresses to the Association, at the time the Association issues the annual Budget.",

(If the City has adopted a more restrictive regulation, the more\nrestrictive regulation shall apply).\n• Parking:\nAll vehicles, specifically those of contractors, must be parked in a neat and orderly fashion\nand may not be parked in any fire lanes or perpendicular to the curb. It is the homeowner’s\nresponsibility to monitor the situation and make certain their contractors comply.\nI have received these rules and have gone over them with my contractor.\nOwners Signature: Date:\nI have received these rules and agreed to abide by them.\nContractors Signature: Date:\nTurtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association\nArchitectural Application Process\nRevised January 12, 2024\nThe TRCMA ECC wants to begin more consistent in enforcing the provisions of the current\nTRCMA Architectural Guidelines (\"the Guidelines\") pertaining to submission of plans,\napplication fees, security deposits and Indemnity, Maintenance and Restoration Agreements.\nPlans\nThe Guidelines require a homeowner applicant to submit with an application three (3) sets of\nplans, and that the plans must be prepared in accordance with applicable building codes, with\nclarity and completeness. After action by the ECC, approved plans are to be distributed: one set\nto the Association's files and two sets to the homeowner, one of which is required to be maintained\nat the work site during the course of construction until final inspection of the completed project\nhas been made by the ECC or its representative. If an application is disapproved the plans\nsubmitted with the application are to be returned to the homeowner applicant and included with\nany resubmittal of the application. Clearly, the plan submission requirements of the Guidelines\ncontemplate printed hard copies of plans, as opposed to digital submissions.\nFor the last several months, the ECC has received and accepted digital submissions which have\nincluded only digital plans, partial plans, and in some cases, no plans or design specifications. This\nhas created a variety of difficulties. To correct this situation, starting immediately, consistently\nwith the Guidelines, three (3) sets (printed hard copies) of complete plans depicting the full scope\nof work the homeowner applicant proposes will be required to be submitted with all Architectural\nApplications. The complete plans submitted should be no smaller than 11\" x 17\".\nThe only exceptions to this requirement will be:\n(1) window replacements (including sliders and French doors), where the homeowner is\nsimply replacing existing windows with new windows of the same size and dimensions, and not\nproposing to add or delete any windows. In these cases, photographic exhibits showing the\nlocations of the proposed replacements and a product tear sheet or sheets with details of the\nproposed replacement windows must be submitted;\n(2) front door and sidelight replacements. In these cases, photographic exhibits showing the\nlocations of the proposed replacements and a product tear sheet or sheets with details of the\nproposed replacement door and sidelights must be submitted;\n(3) garage door and exterior awning replacements. In these cases, a product tear sheet or\nsheets with details of the proposed replacement door or awning (as applicable) must be\nsubmitted; and\n(4) applications for projects for which the stated scope of work is so obviously de minimis that\nrequiring preparation of complete plans would be unreasonable. These cases will be determined\nin the discretion of the ECC. In these cases, a written description of the complete proposed scope\nof work and simple drawings or photographic exhibits depicting the proposed project will be\nrequired.\n1\nTurtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association\nAny Architectural Application submitted that does not include the required plans will be deemed\nincomplete and returned to the homeowner applicant. Going forward, Keystone Architectural\nshould respond to non-complying submissions accordingly, and should not forward them to the\nECC until the required plans have been submitted with the application.\nApplication Fee\nThe Guidelines require a $2,500.00 application fee for \"major remodels\" to cover the Association's\ncost of consultants and potential legal opinions. \"Major remodels\" is not well-defined in the\nGuidelines, but stated exclusions are window replacements, garage door replacements and \"minor\nremodels,\" which term is not defined. Any portion of the $2,500.00 remaining after the ECC has\nmade its decision on the application is refunded to the homeowner or applied toward the security\ndeposit (see below).\nStarting immediately, the ECC will require that this $2,500.00 application fee be submitted with\nall Architectural Applications except applications for projects in categories (1) through (4) above.\nAny Architectural Application submitted without the required $2,500.00 application fee will be\ndeemed incomplete and returned to the homeowner applicant. Going forward, Keystone\nArchitectural should respond to non-complying submissions accordingly, and should not forward\nthem to the ECC until the required $2,500.00 application fee has been submitted with the\napplication.\nSecurity Deposit\nThe Guidelines provide that major remodels require execution of a Security Deposit Agreement\nand a $2,500.00 security deposit to cover: (1) costs of restoration or repairs to common areas; (2)\npayment of any fines levied by the Association based on violations of the CC&R's or the\nGuidelines in conjunction with the construction of the proposed improvements; or (3)\nreimbursement for costs incurred by the Association in retaining a qualified consultant (e.g., an\narchitect or engineer) to review plans and/or inspect the works of improvement. Any portion of\nthe security deposit not utilized for (1) - (3) above will be returned to the homeowner applicant\nafter completion of the proposed improvements.\nStarting immediately, the ECC will require that this Security Deposit Agreement and $2,500.00\nsecurity deposit be executed and paid with Architectural Applications except applications for\nprojects in categories (1) through (4) on page 1. Approval of any Architectural Application\nrequiring a Security Deposit Agreement and $2,500.00 security deposit will be expressly\nconditioned on the homeowner applicant's execution and delivery of the Security Deposit\nAgreement and $2,500.00 security deposit to the Community Manager.\nIndemnity and Maintenance Agreements; Restoration Agreements\nThe Guidelines provide that, in addition to a security deposit, the ECC may require an indemnity\nor restoration agreement, with the cost of preparation and recording of the agreement to be borne\nby the homeowner applicant. In Paragraph 4 of the Security Deposit Agreement form (Form #3\n2\nTurtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association\nattached to the Guidelines) the homeowner applicant acknowledges that they may be required to\nexecute a separate Indemnity Agreement with the Association providing for the future\nmaintenance, repair, or replacement of the project improvements by the homeowner applicant or\nsuccessor owners of the unit.\nStarting immediately, whenever any kind of indemnity, restoration or maintenance agreement is\nrequired as a condition of ECC approval of any application, the ECC will require that the required\nindemnity, restoration or maintenance agreement be executed by the homeowner applicant and on\nbehalf of the Association, and recorded, prior to the ECC approval of such application being\neffective, and until the required indemnity, restoration or maintenance agreement be executed by\nthe homeowner applicant and on behalf of the Association, and recorded, the application shall be\ndeemed not approved.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions concerning the above.\nTRCMA ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL COMMITTEE\nKeith Eyrich\nEnvironmental Control Committee Chairperson\n3\n",

While onsite, reflective tape must be around the dumpster and the dumpster must be kept neat and tidy with a daily cleanup. Large (walk-in) dumpsters are not permitted to be placed on the homeowner’s exclusive use driveway • Portable Toilets: Portable toilets must be kept in the homeowner’s courtyard or garage and may not be visible from the street or a neighboring unit. • Building Materials: All building materials (lumber, sand, stone, brick, etc.) must be stored in the courtyard or garage and may not be visible from the street or a neighboring unit. • Hours for Construction Work: Construction activities may occur 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM Monday-Friday, and 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM on weekends.",
      "(If the City has adopted a more restrictive regulation, the more restrictive regulation shall apply). • Parking: All vehicles, specifically those of contractors, must be parked in a neat and orderly fashion and may not be parked in any fire lanes or perpendicular to the curb. It is the homeowner’s responsibility to monitor the situation and make certain their contractors comply. I have received these rules and have gone over them with my contractor. Owners Signature: Date: I have received these rules and agreed to abide by them. Contractors Signature: Date: Turtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association Architectural Application Process Revised January 12, 2024 The TRCMA ECC wants to begin more consistent in enforcing the provisions of the current TRCMA Architectural Guidelines (\"the Guidelines\") pertaining to submission of plans, application fees, security deposits and Indemnity, Maintenance and Restoration Agreements.",
      "Plans The Guidelines require a homeowner applicant to submit with an application three (3) sets of plans, and that the plans must be prepared in accordance with applicable building codes, with clarity and completeness. After action by the ECC, approved plans are to be distributed: one set to the Association's files and two sets to the homeowner, one of which is required to be maintained at the work site during the course of construction until final inspection of the completed project has been made by the ECC or its representative. If an application is disapproved the plans submitted with the application are to be returned to the homeowner applicant and included with any resubmittal of the application. Clearly, the plan submission requirements of the Guidelines contemplate printed hard copies of plans, as opposed to digital submissions.",
      "For the last several months, the ECC has received and accepted digital submissions which have included only digital plans, partial plans, and in some cases, no plans or design specifications. This has created a variety of difficulties. To correct this situation, starting immediately, consistently with the Guidelines, three (3) sets (printed hard copies) of complete plans depicting the full scope of work the homeowner applicant proposes will be required to be submitted with all Architectural Applications. The complete plans submitted should be no smaller than 11\" x 17\". The only exceptions to this requirement will be: (1) window replacements (including sliders and French doors), where the homeowner is simply replacing existing windows with new windows of the same size and dimensions, and not proposing to add or delete any windows.",
      "In these cases, photographic exhibits showing the locations of the proposed replacements and a product tear sheet or sheets with details of the proposed replacement windows must be submitted; (2) front door and sidelight replacements. In these cases, photographic exhibits showing the locations of the proposed replacements and a product tear sheet or sheets with details of the proposed replacement door and sidelights must be submitted; (3) garage door and exterior awning replacements. In these cases, a product tear sheet or sheets with details of the proposed replacement door or awning (as applicable) must be submitted; and (4) applications for projects for which the stated scope of work is so obviously de minimis that requiring preparation of complete plans would be unreasonable. These cases will be determined in the discretion of the ECC.",
      "In these cases, a written description of the complete proposed scope of work and simple drawings or photographic exhibits depicting the proposed project will be required. 1 Turtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association Any Architectural Application submitted that does not include the required plans will be deemed incomplete and returned to the homeowner applicant. Going forward, Keystone Architectural should respond to non-complying submissions accordingly, and should not forward them to the ECC until the required plans have been submitted with the application. Application Fee The Guidelines require a $2,500.00 application fee for \"major remodels\" to cover the Association's cost of consultants and potential legal opinions. \"Major remodels\" is not well-defined in the Guidelines, but stated exclusions are window replacements, garage door replacements and \"minor remodels,\" which term is not defined.",
      "Any portion of the $2,500.00 remaining after the ECC has made its decision on the application is refunded to the homeowner or applied toward the security deposit (see below). Starting immediately, the ECC will require that this $2,500.00 application fee be submitted with all Architectural Applications except applications for projects in categories (1) through (4) above. Any Architectural Application submitted without the required $2,500.00 application fee will be deemed incomplete and returned to the homeowner applicant. Going forward, Keystone Architectural should respond to non-complying submissions accordingly, and should not forward them to the ECC until the required $2,500.00 application fee has been submitted with the application.",
      "Security Deposit The Guidelines provide that major remodels require execution of a Security Deposit Agreement and a $2,500.00 security deposit to cover: (1) costs of restoration or repairs to common areas; (2) payment of any fines levied by the Association based on violations of the CC&R's or the Guidelines in conjunction with the construction of the proposed improvements; or (3) reimbursement for costs incurred by the Association in retaining a qualified consultant (e.g., an architect or engineer) to review plans and/or inspect the works of improvement. Any portion of the security deposit not utilized for (1) - (3) above will be returned to the homeowner applicant after completion of the proposed improvements. Starting immediately, the ECC will require that this Security Deposit Agreement and $2,500.00 security deposit be executed and paid with Architectural Applications except applications for projects in categories (1) through (4) on page 1.",
      "Approval of any Architectural Application requiring a Security Deposit Agreement and $2,500.00 security deposit will be expressly conditioned on the homeowner applicant's execution and delivery of the Security Deposit Agreement and $2,500.00 security deposit to the Community Manager. Indemnity and Maintenance Agreements; Restoration Agreements The Guidelines provide that, in addition to a security deposit, the ECC may require an indemnity or restoration agreement, with the cost of preparation and recording of the agreement to be borne by the homeowner applicant. In Paragraph 4 of the Security Deposit Agreement form (Form #3 2 Turtle Rock Crest Maintenance Association attached to the Guidelines) the homeowner applicant acknowledges that they may be required to execute a separate Indemnity Agreement with the Association providing for the future maintenance, repair, or replacement of the project improvements by the homeowner applicant or successor owners of the unit.",
      "Starting immediately, whenever any kind of indemnity, restoration or maintenance agreement is required as a condition of ECC approval of any application, the ECC will require that the required indemnity, restoration or maintenance agreement be executed by the homeowner applicant and on behalf of the Association, and recorded, prior to the ECC approval of such application being effective, and until the required indemnity, restoration or maintenance agreement be executed by the homeowner applicant and on behalf of the Association, and recorded, the application shall be deemed not approved.

Prior to use of these products on or near a TimberTech Deck, Rail, or Porch, check product labels\nand consult the manufacturer about the product’s effect on plastic materials.\n• Do not get any PVC glue or similar product on the surface of any TimberTech Deck, Rail, or Porch product as it may discolor\nand permanently damage the surface.\n• As with any walking surface, TimberTech Deck or Porch products may become slippery in freezing weather. Take caution when\nwalking in these conditions. For ice removal, most products containing calcium chloride can be used without damage to the\ndeck or porch surface. These products may leave a white residue, which can be cleaned, using the cleaning guidelines, as soon as\ntemperature conditions safely permit the removal of ice-melt products. Avoid rock salt and other abrasive ice melt products.\n• Metal shovels or plastic shovels with a metal leading edge will damage the surface of a TimberTech Deck or Porch and are not\nrecommended for clearing snow from deck surfaces.\n• Do not allow airborne construction dust from materials such as concrete, fiber cement, landscape blocks, stucco, or drywall to\naccumulate on the surface of a TimberTech Deck or Porch as it may cause damage. Do not cut masonry products on or near\ndeck, and always remove job site dust, clay, dirt, mud, and other construction dirt, debris, and products from TimberTech Deck,\nRail, and Porch surfaces quickly.\n• Do not cut metal objects, such as railing, on the deck surface—the hot debris from the cut may become embedded in the deck\nsurface, resulting in staining, rusting, and damage.\nFor TimberTech’s specialty or discontinued composite products (ReliaBoard, TwinFinish, Earthwood, Floorizon, and DockSider), here\nare some additional watch-outs:\n• Like any other wood-based product, TimberTech’s wood-polymer composite products may experience a naturally occurring\nprocess called Extractive Bleeding/Tannins. This process may cause temporary discoloration that will weather away with\nexposure to flushing rainfall and UV. In most cases, the weathering process takes 8–10 weeks but could vary depending\non location and specific product application such as a covered porch. Tannins may also be cleaned by utilizing the cleaners\nreferenced in the cleaning guidelines.\n• To help maintain a clean, dry surface and help prevent mildew, be sure that gaps exist between boards to allow for drainage.\n*TimberTech DeckCleaner is not recommended for historic/\ndiscontinued decking collections, including ReliaBoard, TwinFinish,\nEarthwood, Floorizon, and DockSider. Reference the historic\ndecking section for cleaning guidelines.\n**If composite railing is subject to any hazardous and unusual\nenvironmental factors or is located within one (1) mile of the\nseashore, an estuary, or a marine environment, please call\n877-275-2935 to consult on the best maintenance practices.\n***These cleaners should not be used on TimberTech’s current\nComposite or Advanced PVC Decking.\nAZEK Building Products\n1330 W.

      "Examples of these harmful cleaners are Goof Off®, Wal-Mart Great Value All Purpose Cleaner® (glycol ether), 409 General Purpose® (2-Butoxyethanol) and Greased Lightning® (glycol ether), citrus cleaners, abrasive cleaners, and solvents such as acetone, paint remover, and lacquer. 4 TimberTech.com 5 PROACTIVE CARE FOR DECKS & DOCKS To keep your TimberTech Deck or Porch looking its best, here are a few things to watch out for: • Avoid the use of rubber-backed mats, tarps, pool toys, and other nonporous items on the deck for any extended period of time as these items can contain chemicals and/or plasticizers that may cause discoloration to the decking surface. • Some products, such as sunblock and insect repellent, contain chemicals that may alter the surface of TimberTech Deck, Rail, or Porch and Rim Joist Covers. Prior to use of these products on or near a TimberTech Deck, Rail, or Porch, check product labels and consult the manufacturer about the product’s effect on plastic materials.",
      "• Do not get any PVC glue or similar product on the surface of any TimberTech Deck, Rail, or Porch product as it may discolor and permanently damage the surface. • As with any walking surface, TimberTech Deck or Porch products may become slippery in freezing weather. Take caution when walking in these conditions. For ice removal, most products containing calcium chloride can be used without damage to the deck or porch surface. These products may leave a white residue, which can be cleaned, using the cleaning guidelines, as soon as temperature conditions safely permit the removal of ice-melt products. Avoid rock salt and other abrasive ice melt products. • Metal shovels or plastic shovels with a metal leading edge will damage the surface of a TimberTech Deck or Porch and are not recommended for clearing snow from deck surfaces.",
      "• Do not allow airborne construction dust from materials such as concrete, fiber cement, landscape blocks, stucco, or drywall to accumulate on the surface of a TimberTech Deck or Porch as it may cause damage. Do not cut masonry products on or near deck, and always remove job site dust, clay, dirt, mud, and other construction dirt, debris, and products from TimberTech Deck, Rail, and Porch surfaces quickly. • Do not cut metal objects, such as railing, on the deck surface—the hot debris from the cut may become embedded in the deck surface, resulting in staining, rusting, and damage. For TimberTech’s specialty or discontinued composite products (ReliaBoard, TwinFinish, Earthwood, Floorizon, and DockSider), here are some additional watch-outs: • Like any other wood-based product, TimberTech’s wood-polymer composite products may experience a naturally occurring process called Extractive Bleeding/Tannins.",
      "This process may cause temporary discoloration that will weather away with exposure to flushing rainfall and UV. In most cases, the weathering process takes 8–10 weeks but could vary depending on location and specific product application such as a covered porch. Tannins may also be cleaned by utilizing the cleaners referenced in the cleaning guidelines. • To help maintain a clean, dry surface and help prevent mildew, be sure that gaps exist between boards to allow for drainage. *TimberTech DeckCleaner is not recommended for historic/ discontinued decking collections, including ReliaBoard, TwinFinish, Earthwood, Floorizon, and DockSider. Reference the historic decking section for cleaning guidelines. **If composite railing is subject to any hazardous and unusual environmental factors or is located within one (1) mile of the seashore, an estuary, or a marine environment, please call 877-275-2935 to consult on the best maintenance practices.",
